<h2>Configuration managament. Entry point.</h2>
<ul>
<li> Index for some wiki database can be managed in three ways, as:
	<ul>
		<li><i>single</i> index - all wiki documents are stored into single lucene index
		<li><i>mainsplit</i> index - index split into two parts. One containing only pages from
			the main namespace, and the other all other pages. Optimal search performance 
			(when index needs to be split into parts), since in most cases, users want to search 
			only the main namespace.
		<li><i>split</i> index - index is split into N parts, pages are randomly assigned to 
			index parts, this results in gracefull degradation and enables splitting the index
			in arbitrary number of strips. Largest overhead, both searching and indexing. 
	</ul>
<li> Each index is identified with a fully qualified name <i>dbname.part</i> (for <i>single</i> indexes <i>part</i> is omitted).
	E.g. enwiki.part1, srwiki, dewiki.mainpart, dewiki.restpart ...
<li> Local subdirectory structure: 
	<ul>
		<li>&lt;basedir&gt;/index/&lt;iid&gt; - index while being built (on indexer hosts)
		<li>&lt;basedir&gt;/snapshot/&lt;iid&gt;/&lt;timestamp&gt; - clean snapshots of the index (on indexer hosts)
		<li>&lt;basedir&gt;/update/&lt;iid&gt;/&lt;timestamp&gt; - local copy of index snapshot (on searcher hosts)
		<li>&lt;basedir&gt;/search/&lt;iid&gt; - symlink to latest index update (on searcher hosts)
	</ul>
<li> 
</ul>
