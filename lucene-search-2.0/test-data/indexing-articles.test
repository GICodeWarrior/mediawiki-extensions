# title = Robin Hood
# content
'''Robin Hood''' is a [[folk hero]]. A legendary person whom people have told stories about for many years. Robin Hood is one who still remains popular. His story has been featured in books, plays, movies and cartoons as well.

In most stories Robin Hood is an [[outlaw]] who lives in [[Sherwood Forest]] near the town of [[Nottingham, England]]. His arch-nemesises are [[Prince John]], whom is temporarily on the throne because his brother, [[King Richard the Lionhearted]] is off in the [[Middle East]] fighting the [[Crusades]] and the corrupt [[Sheriff of Nottingham]], who abuse their powers and take money from the innocent and people who need it. Robin Hood uses his skills of archery and wits to steal the money and give it back to the poor. Accompanying him are his gang ([[The Merry Men]]), including [[Maid Marian]] (his girlfriend), [[Little John]], and [[Friar Tuck]].

# title = Betty Ford
# content
'''Elizabeth Ann Bloomer Warren Ford''' (born [[April 8]], [[1918]]) is the [[wife]] of [[Gerald R. Ford]], the 38th [[President (United States)|President of the United States]]. She acted as the [[First Lady of the United States]] from [[1974]] to [[1977]].

Her birthplace is [[Chicago, Illinois]]. Her birth name was Betty Bloomer. Her parents were Hortense Neahr and William Stephenson Bloomer. She was the third child of her parents. She had two older brothers named Robert and William, Jr. She spent her childhood in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]] and [[graduation|graduated from school there. In 1935, she graduated in [[dance]] from the Calla Travis Dance Studio. She gave dance [[lesson]]s to earn money during the [[Great Depression]]. 

Betty Bloomer married William G. (Bill) Warren, a [[furniture]] salesman. But the marriage did not last long. They divorced in 1947. 

After that she started [[dating]] Gerald Ford. Ford was a good [[football]] player at his college, and a graduate of the [[University of Michigan]] and [[Yale Law School]]. They married on [[15 October]] [[1948]].  The Fords have three sons and one daughter:
*Michael Gerald Ford (born 1950) - a [[minister]]
*John Gardner "Jack" Ford (born 1952) - a [[journalist]] and [[public relations]] [[consultant]]
*Steven Meigs Ford (born 1956) - an [[actor]] and [[rodeo]] rider
*Susan Elizabeth (Ford) Vance Bales (born 1957) - a [[photographer]]

As of [[2005]], the Fords have seven grandchildren.

In 1974, [[President (United States)|President]] [[Richard Nixon]] [[resignation|resigned]]. Nixon had named Gerald Ford as the [[Vice President of the United States]]. After Nixon's resignation, Ford became the 38th President of the United States.  Betty Ford became the First Lady.

As the First Lady, Betty Ford played an active role. She spoke on many issues. She spoke on [[politics|political]] and many other things. She had an open mind, and spoke honestly about [[benefit]] of mild [[psychiatric treatment]]. She also talked about [[marijuana]] use and [[premarital sex]]. She always supported [[women's rights]]. Her [[surgery]] for [[breast cancer]] made the public more aware of this disease. 

In [[1987]], Betty Ford found a place into the [[Michigan Women's Hall of Fame]]. In [[1978]], she [[ppublished]] her [[autobiography]] ''The Times of My Life''. In [[1999]], President Gerald Ford and Betty Ford jointly got  the [[Congressional Gold Medal]], "in recognition of their dedicated [[public service]] and outstanding [[humanitarian]] [[contribution]]s to the people of the United States of America." [http://www.congressionalgoldmedal.com/GeraldandBettyFord.htm]

In [[2003]] Betty Ford published ''Healing and Hope: Six Women from the Betty Ford Center Share Their Powerful Journeys of Addiction and Recovery''.

As of 2005, she remains the active [[Chairman]] of the [[board of directors|Board of Directors]] of the Betty Ford Center.

''the following are ideas, not yet policy''

There is little [[brilliant prose]] yet in the [[Simple English Wikipedia]], but it is never too early to set high standards.  To nominate an article, simply add it below.

Some criteria which apply to the article not relevant to Full English:

*Any word not on a reasonable [[defining vocabulary]] list of [[2000 words]] should be linked to its own article or to the [[Simple English Wiktionary]] ([[wiktionary:Main Page|here).  Which is better is still under debate.

*There should be no run-on sentences - this is much more important in [[Simple English]].  Substitute two shorter ones.

*The article should deal sensitively and fully with common concerns of the Simple English Users most likely to take an interest in it.  Unlike the Full English articles, the ones in Simple are much more likely to be used as examples in classes in non-English-speaking nations.  Where something uncomfortable has to be said, it should be said with references and links to other more specific articles.  It should never give the impression that it was written from a condescending or patronising [[point of view]].  It should be carefully vetted for any trace of [[racism]] or implied assumption of superiority of cultures.

If you have any objection at all to the article being listed as [[Brilliant Prose]], just remove it from the list.  No explanation at all is ever required. Or you improve the article so that the objections no longer apply.

----------

Candidates (with the first date that a non-author nominated them) are:

* [[History of Australia]] (once it's wikified) [[User:Angela|Angela]] 02:34, 18 Dec 2003 (UTC)  
** Agreed.  It looks somewhat wikified now... worth adding to the [[Brilliant Prose]] page? [[User:Sj|Sj]] 11:13, 13 Mar 2004 (UTC)
**'''Agreed'''[[User:Dejvid|Dejvid]] 7 July 2005 20:03 (UTC)

* [[Units of measurement]], even though it could be longer. [[User:Sj|Sj]] 11:13, 13 Mar 2004 (UTC)

[[James Clark Maxwell]] found in [[1868]] four equations to describe all phenonemas of [[electromagnetism]]:

and

: <math>\nabla \cdot</math> is the [[divergence]] [[operator]] (SI unit: 1 per metre), 

: <math>\nabla \times</math> is the [[curl]] operator (SI unit: 1 per metre).

==The meaning of the equations==

=== Charge density and the electric field ===

: <math>\nabla \cdot \mathbf{D} = \rho</math>,

where <math>{\rho}</math> is the ''free'' electric charge density (in units of C/m<sup>3</sup>), not including dipole charges bound in a material, and <math>\mathbf{D}</math> is the [[electric displacement field]] (in units of C/m<sup>2</sup>). This equation corresponds to [[Coulomb's law]] for stationary charges in vacuum.

The equivalent integral form (by the [[divergence theorem]]), also known as Gauss' law, is:

: <math>\oint_A \mathbf{D} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = Q_\mbox{enclosed}</math>

where <math>d\mathbf{A}</math> is the area of a differential square on the closed surface A with an outward facing surface normal defining its direction, and <math>Q_\mbox{enclosed}</math> is the free charge enclosed by the surface.

In a ''linear material'', <math>\mathbf{D}</math> is directly related to the electric field <math>\mathbf{E}</math> via a material-dependent constant called the [[permittivity]], <math>\epsilon</math>:

:<math>\mathbf{D} = \varepsilon \mathbf{E}</math>.

Any material can be treated as linear, as long as the electric field is not extremely strong.  The permittivity of free space is referred to as <math>\epsilon_0</math>, and appears in:

:<math>\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho_t}{\varepsilon_0}</math>

where, again, <math>\mathbf{E}</math> is the electric field (in units of V/m), <math>\rho_t</math> is the total charge density (including bound charges), and <math>\epsilon_0</math> (approximately 8.854 pF/m) is the permittivity of free space.  <math>\epsilon</math> can also be written as <math>\varepsilon_0 \cdot \varepsilon_r</math>, where <math>\epsilon_r</math> is the material's relative permittivity or its ''[[dielectric constant]]''.

Compare [[Poisson's equation]].

=== The structure of the magnetic field ===

:<math>\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0</math>

<math>\mathbf{B}</math> is the magnetic flux density (in units of teslas, T), also called the magnetic induction.

Equivalent integral form: 

: <math>\oint_A \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = 0</math>

<math>d\mathbf{A}</math> is the area of a differential square on the surface <math>A</math> with an outward facing surface normal defining its direction.

This equation only works if the integral is done over a closed surface.
This equation says, that in every volume the sum of the incoming magnetic field lines equuals the sum of the outgoing magnetical field lines. This means that the magnetic field lines must be closed loops. Another way of putting it is that the field lines cannot originate from somewhere. 
Mathematically formulated: "There are no [[magnetic monopole]]s".

=== A changing magnetic flux and the electric field ===

: <math>\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac {\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}</math>

Equivalent integral Form:

: <math> \oint_{s} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{s} - \oint_s \mathbf{B} \times \mathbf {v} \cdot  d \mathbf{l} = - \frac {d\Phi_{\mathbf{B}}} {dt}</math> where <math> \Phi_{\mathbf{B}} = \int_{A} \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{A}</math>

where

&Phi;<sub><b>B</b></sub> is the magnetic flux through the area A described by the second equation

<b>E</b> is the electric field generated by the magnetic flux

<b>s</b> is a closed path in which current is induced, such as a wire

<b>v</b> is the instantaneous velocity of the line element (for moving circuits).

The [[electromotive force]] (sometimes denoted <math>\mathcal{E}</math>, not to be confused with the permittivity above) is equal to the value of this integral.

This law corresponds to the Faraday's law of [[electromagnetic induction]].

Some textbooks show the right hand sign of the Integral form with an ''N'' (representing the number of coils of wire that are around the edge of ''A'') in front of the flux derivative. The ''N'' can be taken care of in calculating ''A'' (multiple wire coils means multiple surfaces for the flux to go through), and it is an engineering detail so it has been omitted here.

The negative sign is necessary to maintain conservation of energy. It is so important that it even has its own name, [[Lenz's law]].

This equation relates the electric and magnetic fields. This equation e.g. describes how [[electric motor]]s and [[electric generator]]s work. In a motor or generator, the fixed excitation is provided by the [[Field (physics)|field]] circuit and the varying voltage is measured across the [[armature (electrical engineering)|armature]] circuit.
Maxwell's equations apply to a right-handed coordinate system. To apply them unmodified to a left handed system would mean a reversal of polarity of magnetic fields (not inconsistent, but confusingly against convention).

=== The source of the magnetic field ===

:<math> \nabla \times \mathbf{H} = \mathbf{J} + \frac {\partial \mathbf{D}} {\partial t}</math>

where <b>H</b> is the [[magnetic field strength]] (in units of A/m), related to the magnetic flux <b>B</b> by a constant called the [[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]], &mu; (<b>B</b> = &mu;<b>H</b>), and <b>J</b> is the '''current density''', defined by: <b>J</b> = &int;&rho;<sub>q</sub><b>v</b>dV where <b>v</b> is a vector field called the drift velocity that describes the velocities of that charge carriers which have a density described by the scalar function &rho;<sub>q</sub>.

In free space, the permeability &mu; is the permeability of free space, &mu;<sub>0</sub>, which is defined to be <em>exactly</em> 4&pi;&times;10<sup>-7</sup> W/A·m.  Also, the permittivity becomes the permittivity of free space &epsilon;<sub>0</sub>.  Thus, in free space, the equation becomes:

:<math>\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0\varepsilon_0  \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}</math>

Equivalent integral form:

:<math>\oint_s \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{s} = \mu_0 I_\mbox{encircled} + \mu_0\varepsilon_0  \int_A \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} \cdot d \mathbf{A}</math>

''s'' is the edge of the open surface ''A'' (any surface with the curve ''s'' as its edge will do), and ''I''<sub>encircled</sub> is the current encircled by the curve ''s'' (the current through any surface is defined by the equation: ''I''<sub>through ''A''</sub> = &int;''<sub>A</sub><b>J</b>·d<b>A</b>).''

If the [[electric flux density]] does not vary rapidly, the second term on the right hand side (the displacement flux) is negligible, and the equation reduces to [[Ampère's law|Ampere's law]].

==Covariant Formulation==

There are only two covariant Maxwell Equations, because the covariant field vector includes the electrical and the magnetical field.


''Mathematical note: In this section the [[abstract index notation]] will be used.''

In special relativity, in order to more clearly express the fact that Maxwell's equations (in vacuum) take the same form in any inertial coordinate system, the vacuum Maxwell's equations are written in terms of [[four-vector]]s and tensors in the "manifestly covariant" form:

:<math>J^ b = \partial_a F^{ab} \,\!</math>,

and

:<math>0 = \partial_c F_{ab} + \partial_b F_{ca} + \partial_a F_{bc}</math>

the last of which is equivalent to:
:<math>0 = \epsilon_{dabc}\partial^a F^{bc} \,\! </math>

where <math>\, J^a</math> is the [[4-current]], <math>\, F^{ab}</math> is the [[electromagnetic tensor|field strength tensor]]  (written as a 4 &times; 4 [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]), <math>\, \epsilon_{abcd}</math> is the [[Levi-Civita symbol]], and <math>\partial_a = (\partial/\partial ct, \nabla)</math> is the 4-gradient (so that <math>\partial_a \partial^a</math> is the [[d'Alembertian]] operator).  (The <math>a</math> in the first equation is implicitly summed over, according to [[Einstein notation]].) The first tensor equation expresses the two inhomogeneous Maxwell's equations: Gauss' law and Ampere's law with Maxwell's correction.  The second equation expresses the other two, homogenous equations: Faraday's law of induction and the absence of [[magnetic monopole]]s.

More explicitly, <math>J^a  = \,  (c \rho, \vec J) </math> (as a [[contravariant vector]]), in terms of the charge density &rho; and the current density <math>\vec J</math>.  The 4-current satisfies the continuity equation 

<math>J^a{}_{,a} \, = 0</math>

In terms of the [[4-potential]] (as a contravariant vector) <math>A^{a} =  \left(\phi, \vec A c \right)</math>, where &phi; is the electric potential and <math>\vec A</math> is the magnetic vector potential in the Lorenz gauge <math>\left ( \partial_a A^a = 0 \right )</math>, ''F'' can be expressed as:

:<math>F^{ab} = \partial^b A^a - \partial^a A^b \,\!</math>

which leads to the 4 &times; 4 matrix rank-2 tensor:

:<math>F^{ab} = \left(
\begin{matrix}
0 & -\frac {E_x}{c} & -\frac {E_y}{c} & -\frac {E_z}{c} \\
\frac{E_x}{c} & 0 & -B_z & B_y \\
\frac{E_y}{c}  & B_z & 0 & -B_x \\
\frac{E_z}{c} & -B_y & B_x & 0
\end{matrix}
\right) .</math>

The fact that both electric and magnetic fields are combined into a single tensor expresses the fact that, according to relativity, both of these are different aspects of the same thing&mdash;by changing frames of reference, what seemed to be an electric field in one frame can appear as a magnetic field in another frame, and vice versa.

Using the tensor form of Maxwell's equations, the first equation implies 

<math>\Box F^{ab} = 0</math>
(See [[Electromagnetic four-potential]] for the relationship between the d'Alembertian of the four-potential and the four-current, expressed in terms of the older vector operator notation).

Different authors sometimes employ different sign conventions for the above tensors and 4-vectors (which does not affect the physical interpretation).

<math>\, F^{ab}</math> and <math>\, F_{ab}</math> are ''not'' the same: they are related by the [[Minkowski metric]] tensor <math>\eta</math>: <math>F_{ab} =\,  \eta_{ac} \eta_{bd} F^{cd}</math>. This introduces sign changes in some of ''F'''s components; more complex metric dualities are encountered in [[general relativity]].
