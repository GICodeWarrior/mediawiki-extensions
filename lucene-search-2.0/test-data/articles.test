The kaval (кавал) is a chromatic end-blown flute traditionally played
throughout Azerbaijan, Turkey, Bulgaria, Republic of Macedonia, Kosovo
/ Albania (Kavall), northern Greece (Kavali or Dzhamara), southern
Romania (Caval), Armenia (Blur) and Kurdistan (Blul). The kaval is
primarily associated with mountain shepherds throughout the Balkans
and Anatolia and in the book "KAVAL: Traditional Folk Melodies for
Balkan & Anatolian Folk Flute", author Pat MacSwyney suggests that the
kaval was spread throughout these regions by Yoruk nomads who
inhabited the Pindus, Shar, Pirin, Rhodope mountains of the southern
European Balkan peninsula and the Taurus mountains of southern Turkey.

Unlike the transverse flute, the kaval is fully open at both ends, and
is played by blowing on the sharpened edge of one end. The kaval has 8
playing holes (7 in front and 1 in the back for thumb) and usually 4
"devil's holes" down near the bottom of the kaval. The devil's holes
are supposed to improve tone and intonation. There is a Bulgarian folk
tale in which the devil tries to out-play a shepherd in a musical
dual. While the shepherd is sleeping, the devil drilled holes in the
shepherds kaval but instead of ruining the kaval, this only served to
enhance the shepherd's kaval playing thus thwarting the devil. While
typically made of wood, kavals are also made from Arundo donax
Linnaeus 1753 (Persian Reed), metal and plastic.

And what about šupelka? The šupelka is similar to the kaval (open on
both ends), except that it is shorter (240-350 mm). It can be made of
either walnut, barberry, ash wood, maple or other wood.
