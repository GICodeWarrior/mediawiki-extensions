This directory contains an XMPP client program/library for receiving and
processing XMLRC messages, namely rcclient.py. If run standalone, it will
listen for RC messages, analyze the XML data and print the information
if found to the shell.

When used as a library, rcclient provides a class for listening for
messages, RCClient. Implementations of RCHandler can be registered with
the client, and will be called for every RC message received.

NOTE: You can place this directory anywhere on your system. In fact, for
security reasons, it is recommended to move it to a location that is not
accessible from the web or by the web server.

To use rcclient.py, you need python 2.5 and the xmpppy library from 
<http://xmpppy.sourceforge.net/>. You also need an account on an XMPP
(Jabber) server for use by udp2xmpp.py. 

In order to configure rcclient for use with your wiki, rename 
rcclient.ini.sample to rcclient.ini. Put the credentials for your XMPP
account into rcclient.ini (see comments inside).

When everything is configured, you can start rcclient.py simply by typing:

  python rcclient.py

If you want to join a chat room (that is, if udp2xmpp.py sends the messages
to a chat room), you have to specify the romm's JID:

  python rcclient.py recentchanges@conference.jabber.example.com
