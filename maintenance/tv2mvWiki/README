http://slugforge.cse.ucsc.edu/gf/project/metavid/
but I don't recomend using them not genneraly applicable.



The genneral flow and machine layout should be as follows:
note: obvisuly your layout may differ and adjustments may be needed.

dependencies:
	metavidWiki
	ffmpeg2theora
	icecast
	~Video for Linux~ compatible capture hardware


Scripts Run level:

==box_config==
box_name =(optional if left empty will use IP)
box_ip = ip address of the machine
machine_roles = capture|transcode|mediaServer


==default config==
the base set of variables
log_level = debug|error
log_location = /path/to/log_file

//will run demon scripts based on machine role
mv2mvWiki_demon.php


===capture===
capture_demon.php
