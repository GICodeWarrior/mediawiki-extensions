== Semantic MediaWiki maintenance scripts ==

To run maintenance scripts it is recomended to set the environment
variable MW_INSTALL_PATH to the root of your MediaWiki install.
Then you may run them from their location here, or in the maintenance
directory.

Otherwise maintenance scripts must be placed within the "./maintenance"
directory of your MediaWiki installation. In most cases, it is best to do
this via a symbolic link, e.g.

% ln -s ./myMediaWiki/extensions/SemanticMediaWiki/maintenance/SMW_dumpRDF.php ./myMediaWiki/maintenance/SMW_dumpRDF.php

Scripts can be run with a command line PHP call if your MediaWiki is 
properly configured to run maintenance scripts.
