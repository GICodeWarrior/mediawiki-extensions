Extension page on mediawiki.org: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:SubPageList
Latest version of the install file: http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/trunk/extensions/SubPageList/INSTALL?view=co


== Download ==

You can find the current version of SubPageList on the [https://code.google.com/p/subpagelist/downloads/list Google Code download page],
as well as a [https://code.google.com/p/subpagelist/downloads/list?can=1 list of legacy downloads].

You can also get the code directly from SVN. Tags can be obtained via

 svn checkout <nowiki>http://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/mediawiki/tags/extensions/SubPageList/REL_version</nowiki>

Where 'version' is the version number of the tag, such as 0_1 (see the [http://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/mediawiki/tags/extensions/SubPageList/ available tags]).
The latest code can be obtained from trunk:

 svn checkout <nowiki>http://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/mediawiki/trunk/extensions/SubPageList/</nowiki>

SubPageList requires [[Extension:Validator|Validator]] 0.4.2 or above in order to work. A compatible
copy of Validator always comes bundled with the regular releases, and is automatically loaded by SubPageList,
so you do not need to worry about it when using one of these. If you are getting the code from SVN, make
sure you also get a copy of Validator ([[Extension:Validator#Download|see here for instructions]]).

== Installation ==

Once you have downloaded the code, place the ''SubPageList'' and ''Validator'' directories within your
MediaWiki 'extensions' directory. Then add the following code to your [[Manual:LocalSettings.php|LocalSettings.php]] file:

<source lang="php">
# SubPageList
require_once( "$IP/extensions/SubPageList/SubPageList.php" );
</source>

== Configuration ==

Configuration of SubPageList is done by adding simple PHP statements to your [[Manual:LocalSettings.php|LocalSettings.php]]
file. These statements need to be placed AFTER the inclusion of SubPageList. The options are listed below and their default
is set in the [http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/trunk/extensions/SubPageList/SubPageList.settings.php?view=markup SubPageList settings file].
You should NOT modify the settings file, but can have a look at it to get an idea of how to use the  settings, in case the below descriptions do not suffice.

As of version 0.3, you can choose to automatically refresh subpage lists
that are on the base page of subpages you add, move or delete, or on one
of the subpages of the base page. This behaviour is off by default as it
can produce extra load on your server, but can be turned on with this code:

$egSPLAutorefresh = true;

=== General subpage settings ===

MediaWiki itself has some support for subpages, which causes back links
to be displayed on subpages to their parent pages. To enable this you
need to set [[Manual:$wgNamespacesWithSubpages|wgNamespacesWithSubpages]],
which is a per namespace setting, like shown below:

$wgNamespacesWithSubpages[NS_MAIN] = 1;
