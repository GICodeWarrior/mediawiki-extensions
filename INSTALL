[[Maps 0.5]]

Once you have downloaded the code, place the 'Maps' directory within your MediaWiki 'extensions' directory.
Then add the following code to your LocalSettings.php file after the line that installs Semantic MediaWiki:

# Maps
require_once( "$IP/extensions/Maps/Maps.php" );

For using Google Maps or Yahoo! Maps, you must enter their API keys in the settings file. If you don't already
have them, you can obtain them at the Google Maps API page and Yahoo Maps API page. Note that the Google Maps
API key is required for both displaying maps AND for geocoding (and therefore also required when you use
display_address with a Yahoo! Map). Also note that use of the Google Maps API is free only if your site is
accessible to the public; otherwise it costs money - read the Google Maps terms of service for further details.
