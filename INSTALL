== Installation ==

Installation instructions are available online in a more convenient form for
reading at:

 http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Semantic_Project_Management

Copy all files into MediaWiki's extensions folder, either by using SVN or by
extracting an installation package. You need to enter one line to your local
settings (somewhere after the inclusion of Semantic MediaWiki):

 require_once("$IP/extensions/SemanticProjectManagement/SemanticProjectManagement.php");

Notes on specific formats:
* ganttchart: requires Javascript to render.
