MediaWiki extension QPoll, version 0.8.0a

* download the latest available version and extract it to your wiki extension directory. 
* add the following line to LocalSettings.php 
require_once( "$IP/extensions/QPoll/qp_user.php" );
* setup additional variables in LocalSettins.php, if needed 
* check out Special:Version page to verify the installation 
* login as user that has administrative rights, and go to Special:PollResults page. Database tables will be set up. Alternatively, you may load qpoll.sql to mysql database manually (remember that $wgDBprefix for the tables won't be used!). 

=== Upgrade ===
Do not forget to open Special:Pollresults page to update DB schema (the script runs just once).
