Extension page on mediawiki.org: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Live_Translate
Latest version of the install file: http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/trunk/extensions/LiveTranslate/INSTALL?view=co


== Installation ==

Once you have downloaded the code, place the ''LiveTranslate'' directory within your MediaWiki 'extensions' directory.
Then add the following code to your [[Manual:LocalSettings.php|LocalSettings.php]] file:

# Live Translate
require_once( "$IP/extensions/LiveTranslate/LiveTranslate.php" );

After this you need to run MediaWikis update script which can be found at /maintenance/update.php.

After doing this, you have installed the extension. To be able to use it in a meaningful way, you also need to take care of some configuration:

== Configuration ==

Configuration of Live Translate is done by adding simple PHP statements to your [[Manual:LocalSettings.php|LocalSettings.php]]
file. These statements need to be placed AFTER the inclusion of Live Translate. The options are listed below and their default
is set in the [http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/trunk/extensions/LiveTranslate/LiveTranslate_Settings.php?view=markup Live Translate settings file].
You should NOT modify the settings file, but can have a look at it to get an idea of how to use the  settings, in case the below descriptions do not suffice.

=== Google API key ===

To be able to actually use Google Translate, you need to [https://code.google.com/apis/console get an API key] and
add it to your [[LocalSettings.php]] file AFTER the inclusion of the extension.

<source lang="php">
# Google API key
$egGoogleApiKey = 'INSERT-YOUR-KEY-HERE';
</source>

=== Available languages ===

You have to specify which languages users should be able to translate to. This is done by adding language codes to <code>$egLiveTranslateLanguages</code>.
By default it contains only your wikis main language (as specified by <code>$wgLanguageCode</code> in [[LocalSettings.php]]). You add languages as follows:

<source lang="php">
$egLiveTranslateLanguages[] = 'nl';
$egLiveTranslateLanguages[] = 'de';
</source>

If there are no languages available other then the current language of the page, then the translation control will not show up.
