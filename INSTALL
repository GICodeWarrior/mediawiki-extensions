The Distribution extension is dependent on the ExtensionDistributor extension.

Once you have downloaded the code, place the 'Distribution' directory within your MediaWiki 'extensions' directory.
Then add the following code to your LocalSettings.php file:

# Distribution
require_once( "$IP/extensions/Distribution/Distribution.php" );

Make sure you place this code after the inclusion of ExtensionDistributor.
