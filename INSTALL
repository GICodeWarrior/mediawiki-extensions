Latest version of the install file: http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/trunk/extensions/Spark/INSTALL?view=co


== Requirements ==

Spark requires:

* MediaWiki 1.17 or above
* PHP 5.2 or above

== Download ==

You can find the current version of Spark on the Google Code [https://code.google.com/p/rdf-spark/downloads/list?q=label:MediaWiki download page],
as well as a [https://code.google.com/p/rdf-spark/downloads/list?can=1&q=label:MediaWiki list of legacy downloads].

You can also get the code directly from SVN. Tags can be obtained via

 svn checkout <nowiki>http://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/mediawiki/tags/extensions/Spark/REL_version</nowiki>

Where 'version' is the version number of the tag, such as 0_1 (see the [http://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/mediawiki/tags/extensions/Spark/ available tags]).
The latest code can be obtained from trunk:

 svn checkout <nowiki>http://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/mediawiki/trunk/extensions/Spark/</nowiki>

== Installation ==

Once you have downloaded the code, place the ''Spark'' directory within your MediaWiki
'extensions' directory. Then add the following code to your [[Manual:LocalSettings.php|LocalSettings.php]] file:

# Spark
require_once( "$IP/extensions/Spark/Spark.php" );

== Configuration ==

Configuration of Spark is done by adding simple PHP statements to your
[[Manual:LocalSettings.php|LocalSettings.php]] file. These statements need to be placed
AFTER the inclusion of Spark. The options are listed below and their default
is set in the [http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/trunk/extensions/Spark/Spark.settings.php?view=markup Spark settings file].
You should NOT modify the settings file, but can have a look at it to get an idea of
how to use the  settings, in case the below descriptions do not suffice.

As of version 0.1, there are no settings yet.
