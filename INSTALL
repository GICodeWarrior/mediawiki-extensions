== Disclaimer ==

In general, the extension can be installed into a working wiki without making
any irreversible changes to the source code or database, so you can try out
the software without much risk (though no dedicated uninstall mechanism is
provided).

== Requirements ==

DSMW has been developped on MW 1.14.0. DSMW-0.3.1 and DSMW-0.3.2 has been tested
with version MW-1.13.2, MW-1.14.0, MW-1.15.0 and MW-1.15.1.
The DSMW extension requires an install of Semantic MediaWiki 1.4.2 or 1.4.3
(cf: http://semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Semantic_MediaWiki).
For more details, see those extensions'own
installation requirements.

Important: If you want to run the DSMW tests, you must make a dump of your 
database immediatly after having installed DSMW but before using DSMW.
For more details, see the readme file in the tests directory
[wikipath]/extensions/DSMW/tests.

== Installation ==

'''Remark:'''  Follow these different points carefully for a successful
               installation and do not copy-paste from the example.

(1) Download the zip file and extract it
    Paste the folder named DSMW into the Mediawiki extension folder
    "[wikipath]/extensions/".

(2) Edit LocalSettings.php in the root of your MediaWiki installation,
    and add the following lines near the bottom but BEFORE THE LINES THAT
    ACTIVATE SEMANTIC MEDIAWIKI(cf. requirements):

  require_once "$IP/extensions/DSMW/DSMW.php";
  $wgLogo = "{$wgScriptPath}/extensions/DSMW/files/LogoDSMW.png";


== Since SMW 1.5.0 ==

DSMW is now configured to be used with SMW 1.5, so if you are using DSMW 0.7
with SMW versions < SMW 1.5, you must modify the article "Property:HasOperation".
This article has this content:

[[has type::Record]]
[[has fields::String;String;String;Text]]

replace it with this:

[[has type::String;String;String;Text]]

'''Remark:'''  This must be done before using the 'Articles update' feature.
See www.dsmw.org 

== Example: LocalSettings.php ==

The end of this file should look like this:

//DSMW
require_once "$IP/extensions/DSMW/DSMW.php";
$wgLogo = "{$wgScriptPath}/extensions/DSMW/files/LogoDSMW.png";

//SMW
include_once("$IP/extensions/SemanticMediaWiki/includes/SMW_Settings.php");
enableSemantics($_SERVER['SERVER_NAME']);
