[[Validator 0.2]]

Once you have downloaded the code, place the 'SemanticMaps' directory within
your MediaWiki 'extensions' directory. Then add the following code to your
LocalSettings.php file BEFORE the inclusion of any extensions using Validator:

# Validator
require_once( "$IP/extensions/Validator/Validator.php" );
