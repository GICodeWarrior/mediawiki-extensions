Extension page on mediawiki.org: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Push
Latest version of the install file: http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/trunk/extensions/Push/INSTALL?view=co


== Installation ==

Once you have downloaded the code, place the ''Push'' directory within your MediaWiki 'extensions' directory.
Then add the following code to your [[Manual:LocalSettings.php|LocalSettings.php]] file:

# Push
require_once( "$IP/extensions/Push/Push.php" );

== Configuration ==

=== Push targets ===

You can add push targets (wikis you can push content to) by adding elements to the $egPushTarget array in your
[[Manual:LocalSettings.php|LocalSettings.php]] file. The array keys should be the names of your wikis and the
values should point to the wiki root, without tailing slash. Example:

$egPushTargets['Local MW 1.16'] = 'http://localhost/mw116';
$egPushTargets['Local MW trunk'] = 'http://localhost/phase3';

=== Tab display ===

When using vector like skins, you can choose to have the push tab displayed on the page itself, or in the action
menu you can open by clicking the down arrow next to the visible tabs. For this you need to set the $egPushShowTab
 variable to either true or false in your [[Manual:LocalSettings.php|LocalSettings.php]] file.
