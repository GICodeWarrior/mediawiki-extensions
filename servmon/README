Servmon is an automated server monitoring tool used on the Wikimedia servers.
It's also meant to be usable elsewhere, but may need some tweaking.  Please send
any changes you make back to me at <keturner@livejournal.com>.

To use servmon you will need:
	- Unix.  It's tested on Solaris and RedHat Linux.  Other systems may or may
	  not work; if you have to make any changes to build it, please let me know.
	  I am interested in supporting non-Unix systems but do not have access to any.
	- A C++ compiler.  GCC <2.95 will not work.  GCC 2.95 may work.   Tested with
	  >= 3.3.
	- The Boost library (http://www.boost.org/).
	- SCons (http://www.scons.org/).
	
To build:
	copy buildconfig.sample to buildconfig and edit as needed;
	run 'scons'
