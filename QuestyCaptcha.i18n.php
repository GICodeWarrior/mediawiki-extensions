While these spam links can be removed, they are a significant nuisance.

Sometimes, especially when adding new web links to a page, the wiki may ask you to answer a question.
Since this is a task that's hard to automate, it will allow most real humans to make their posts while stopping most spammers and other robotic attackers.

Please contact the  [[{{MediaWiki:Grouppage-sysop}}|site administrators]] for assistance if this is unexpectedly preventing you from making legitimate posts.
