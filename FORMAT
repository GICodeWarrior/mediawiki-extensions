The serialized format of the Native Preprocessor is a list of node types with 
indexes to the original text included in that node. It is returned in a php 
string type. For easier debugging, the characters of those string are restricted 
to printable characters.
This string is then returned joined in an array with a refcounted copy of the 
original text.

The full string is formed by two or more nodes.

The node format is as follows:
  +------+-------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+
  | Type | Flags |    Next sibling    |       Content length      |
  +------+-------+------+------+------+------+------+------+------+

Type:
 A character which identifies the kind of node.

Flags:
 A value whose meaning depends on the type. The default value is '0'.

Next sibling:
 6 hexadecimal characters which specify the length in bytes of all its child nodes.

Content lenght:
 8 hexadecimal characters which specify the length in bytes of the text content of this
node in the wikitext. The beginning of the node in the text is implied by all the previous
lengths.

Total node length: 16 bytes.
