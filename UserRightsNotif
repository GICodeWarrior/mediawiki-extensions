== 1. Introduction ==

The user rights email notification extension provides a clean and customisable
means to send email messages to one or more registered users upon a change to
their group memberships. The behaviour of the extension can be controlled using
configuration options within the LocalSettings.php file for MediaWiki.

== 2. Installation requirements ==

This extension requires hooks present in MediaWiki 1.5.9 and later.

== 3. Installing the extension ==

To install the new user email notification extension, first upload/copy the
extension file UserRightsNotif.php into your MediaWiki extensions directory. Then
edit your LocalSettings.php file and add the following line:

	require_once( 'extensions/UserRightsNotif.php' );

Save the file (uploading if applicable) to complete the installation.

== 4. Editing the notification email ==

When preparing the email message to be sent to each recipient, the extension
relies upon two system messages. You will need to create these if you wish
to customise them, as detailed below:

MediaWiki:Userrightsnotifysubject
	This file contains the subject line for the email.
	$1 is replaced with the wiki site name from $wgSitename.

MediaWiki:Userrightsnotifybody
	This file contains the body text for the email.
	$1 is replaced with the username of the recipient;
	$2 is replaced with the wiki site name from $wgSitename;
	$3 is replaced with the username of the user who made the change;
	$4 is replaced with the time and date of the change;
	$5 is replaced with a comma-delimited list of groups added;
	$6 is replaced with a comma-delimited list of groups removed.

== 5. Further configuration ==

To change the sender email address used (the default is the same as
$wgPasswordSender), set the $wgUserRightsNotif['sender'] variable in LocalSettings.php.

== 6. Notes ==

* On wikis where email address authentication is present and active(1), then
  no email is sent unless the recipient's email address is validated.

(1) => MediaWiki 1.5 and later
