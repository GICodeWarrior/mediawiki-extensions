ploticus_encodeclickmapurls.patch 
- required to support imagemaps in SVG.
    To apply the patch, be sure to patch Ploticus 2.40 up the last available patch in Dec 08.
    To use, set "encodeclickmapurls:yes" in PLOTICUS_CONFIG.
    This will force Ploticus to use underscores (_) instead of plus signs (+) when generating imagemap URLs.

prefabs directory
=================
- additional SMW prefabs.  To use, copy the files in this directory into the PLOTICUS prefabs directory. 

* pietopn.pl (In Development)
- similar to pie but with an additional parameter
  topn (specifies the number of top pie slices after which, remaining slices are aggregated into one slice)

* scats.pl
- modified version of scats.pl.  To install, just replace the existing scats.pl.  
For scatter plots, when corr=yes, the Pearson coefficient is displayed.
In the stock version, the variables are displayed right-justified which works without problems using
raster formats (png, gif, jpeg).  However, vector formats (eps,ps,swf,svg) crop the variables out.
