/**
 * This class attempts to provide safe yet simple means for managing data that is relevant
 * for the final HTML output of MediaWiki. In particular, this concerns additions to the HTML
 * header in the form of scripts of stylesheets.
 *
 * The problem is that many components in SMW create hypertext that should eventually be displayed.
 * The normal way of accessing such text are functions of the form getText() which return a
 * (hypertext) string. Such a string, however, might refer to styles or scripts that are also
 * needed. It is not possible to directly add those scripts to the MediaWiki output, since the form
 * of this output depends on the context in which the function is called. Many functions might be
 * called both during parsing and directly in special pages that do not use the usual parsing and
 * caching mechanisms.
 *
 * Ideally, all functions that generate hypertext with dependencies would also include parameters to
 * record required scripts. Since this would require major API changes, the current solution is to have
 * a "temporal" global storage for the required items, managed in this class. It is not safe to use
 * such a global store accross hooks -- you never know what happens in between! Hence, every function
 * that creates SMW outputs that may require head items must afterwards clear the temporal store by
 * writing its contents to the according output.
