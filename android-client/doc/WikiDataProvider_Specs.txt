This document exists to describe how to use the WikiDataProvider system in 
Android applications. It was written as a Content Provider[1] so that its data
can be accessible both within the android-client and to other applications as
well. It serves to be the uniform method for requesting data from MediaWiki
installations.

All queries are accepted using the standard Android Content Provider format.
- The authority (available at WikiDataProvider.AUTHORITY) is "org.mediawiki.android"
- The first parameter is which API to use. Pass the host name of the wiki and we'll
  look it up based on that
- The second parameter is the action for action=whatever (see WikiApi.actions)
- All additional parameters should be in the format of key=value
- Slashes should be escaped with \
