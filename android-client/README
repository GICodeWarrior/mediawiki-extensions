Mediawiki Client for Android
--

Designed to interface with any MediaWiki installation with an open
API.

Version 0.0.7

NOTE: This software is pre-pre-alpha and is not guaranteed to work
on any device at any point. Use at your own risk. Does not build
on 1.0, requires 1.1.

TODO (in no real order):
 1) i18n - check Google's progress in native Android. Possible workarounds?
 2) Make the cache work better
 3) Multiple wiki sources in prefs
 4) User authentication
    -- Have a base User class. Doesn't really work yet
 5) Make data available as a ContentProvider
    -- Partially done. Make it sane! Right now the Cursor is just a retarded 
       wrapper around some raw JSON. Would be AWESOME to get it into a proper
       wrapper with column names and the like.
 6) Make page views actually attractive and usable (not just POC)
