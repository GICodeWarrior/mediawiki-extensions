      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Rio Grande''' (called the '''Rio Bravo''' in [[Mexico]]) is a [[river]] which rises in the [[San Juan Mountains|San Juan Mountains of Colorado]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley|San Luis Valley of Colorado]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas]] on the border with Mexico.
The river is the boundary between Mexico and the United States from El Paso to the [[Gulf of Mexico]].
Major cities along the border are [[Ciudad Juarez, Mexico]] across the river from El Paso; [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]] and [[Nuevo Laredo, Mexico|Nuevo Laredo]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]] and [[Matamoras, Mexico|Matamoras]].
Other notable towns along the river are [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]].

Use of the water of the Rio Grande is regulated by the Rio Grande Compact (need exact name), a treaty between the United States and Mexico, and by an interstate compact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas.
The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more uses for the water than there is water in the river.

The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 3762 feet above sea level. From El Paso eastward the river flows through desert. Only in the sub-tropical lower Rio Grande Valley is there extensive irrigated  agriculure. The river ends in a small sandy delta on the Gulf of Mexico.

Anciently the Rio Grande terminated at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in Lake Cabeza de Baca. About 1 million years ago the steam was &quot;captured&quot; and began to flow eastward. From El Paso eastward the river flows through desert. Only in the sub-tropical lower Rio Grande Valley is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.

The '''Rio Grande''' (called the '''Río Bravo''' or, more formally, the '''Río Bravo del Norte''' in [[Mexico]]) is a [[river]] which rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas]] on the border with Mexico.

The river is the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from El Paso to the [[Gulf of Mexico]].

The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Since the summer of 2003, much of the river from Albuquerque to the [[Big Bend National Park]] has been dry. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next several years, and strict water conservation is adopted by communities along the river route, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct.

The '''Rio Grande''' (called the '''Río Bravo''' or, more formally, the '''Río Bravo del Norte''' in [[Mexico]]) is a [[river]] which rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas]] on the border with Mexico.

The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from El Paso to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that [[Texas|Texan]] slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance. (''See'' [http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf] ''(PDF)''.)

Major cities along the border are [[Ciudad Juárez]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], across the river from El Paso; [[Laredo, Texas]] and [[Nuevo Laredo]], [[Tamaulipas|Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]] and [[Matamoros]], Tamaulipas.  Other notable towns along the river are [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]], both in Texas.

Use of the water of the Rio Grande is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate compact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas; and a treaty between the United States and Mexico. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Since the summer of 2003, much of the river from Albuquerque to the [[Big Bend National Park]] has been dry. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river route, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 

The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 3762 feet (1147m) above sea level. While in New Mexico the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one sediment filled basin to another, cutting canyons between the basins. Anciently the Rio Grande terminated at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Baca]]. About a million years ago [[stream capture|the stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow eastward. From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]]. Only in the sub-tropical lower Rio Grande Valley is there extensive irrigated  agriculture. The river ends in a small sandy delta at the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and no longer actually flows into the Gulf.

The '''Rio Grande''' (called the '''Río Bravo''' or, more formally, the '''Río Bravo del Norte''' in [[Mexico]]) is a [[river]] that rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the Mexican border.

The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that [[Texas|Texan]] slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance. (''See'' [http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf] ''(PDF)''.)

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Laredo, Texas]], and [[Nuevo Laredo]], [[Tamaulipas|Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas]], and [[Reynosa]], Tamaulipas; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros]], Tamaulipas.  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]]. 

Use of the water of the Rio Grande is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate compact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas; and a treaty between the United States and Mexico. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Since the summer of 2003, much of the river from Albuquerque to the [[Big Bend National Park]] has been dry. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river route, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 

The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is  1147 m (3762 feet) above sea level. In New Mexico the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one sediment filled basin to another, cutting canyons between the basins. Anciently the Rio Grande terminated at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Baca]]. About a million years ago [[stream capture|the stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow eastward. From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]]. Only in the sub-tropical lower Rio Grande Valley is there extensive irrigated  agriculture. The river ends in a small sandy delta at the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and no longer actually flows into the Gulf.

[[Image:Stamp-us-rio-grande.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Rio Grande by [[Big Bend National Park]],[[Texas]] ]]

The '''Rio Grande''' (called the '''Río Bravo''' or, more formally, the '''Río Bravo del Norte''' in [[Mexico]]) is a [[river]] that rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the Mexican border.

The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that [[Texas|Texan]] slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance. (''See'' [http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf] ''(PDF)''.)

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Laredo, Texas]], and [[Nuevo Laredo]], [[Tamaulipas|Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa]], Tamaulipas; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros]], Tamaulipas.  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]]. 

Use of the water of the Rio Grande is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate compact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas; and a treaty between the United States and Mexico. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Since the summer of 2003, much of the river from Albuquerque to the [[Big Bend National Park]] has been dry. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river route, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 

The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is  1147 m (3762 feet) above sea level. In New Mexico the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one sediment filled basin to another, cutting canyons between the basins. Anciently the Rio Grande terminated at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Baca]]. About a million years ago [[stream capture|the stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow eastward. From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]]. Only in the sub-tropical lower Rio Grande Valley is there extensive irrigated  agriculture. The river ends in a small sandy delta at the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and no longer actually flows into the Gulf.

[[Image:Stamp-us-rio-grande.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Rio Grande by [[Big Bend National Park]],[[Texas]] ]]

The '''Rio Grande''' (called the '''Río Bravo''' or, more formally, the '''Río Bravo del Norte''' in [[Mexico]]) is a [[river]] that rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the Mexican border.

The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that [[Texas|Texan]] slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance. (''See'' [http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf] ''(PDF)''.)

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Laredo, Texas]], and [[Nuevo Laredo]], [[Tamaulipas|Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa]], Tamaulipas; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros]], Tamaulipas.  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]]. 

Use of the water of the Rio Grande is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas; and a treaty between the United States and Mexico. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Since the summer of 2003, much of the river from Albuquerque to the [[Big Bend National Park]] has been dry. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 

The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 1147 [[meter|m]] (3762 feet) above [[sea level]]. In New Mexico the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins.  From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]]. Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower Rio Grande [[Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

In antiquity, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Baca]].  But about [[geologic time|1 million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

[[Image:Stamp-us-rio-grande.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Rio Grande by [[Big Bend National Park]],[[Texas]] ]]

Known as the '''Rio Grande''' in the [[United States]] and as the '''Río Bravo''' (or, more formally, the '''Río Bravo del Norte''') in [[Mexico]], the [[river]] rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border.

The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance. (''See'' [http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf] ''(PDF)''.)

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Laredo, Texas]], and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros|Matamoros, Tamaulipas]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]]. 

Use of the water of the Rio Grande is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas; and a treaty between the United States and Mexico. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Since the summer of 2003, much of the river from Albuquerque to the [[Big Bend National Park]] has been dry. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct.

Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 

The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 1147 [[meter|m]] (3762 feet) above [[sea level]]. In New Mexico the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]].  From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower Rio Grande [[Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

In antiquity, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Baca]].  But about [[geologic time|1 million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

[[Image:Stamp-us-rio-grande.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Rio Grande by [[Big Bend National Park]],[[Texas]] ]]

Known as the '''Rio Grande''' in the [[United States]] and as the '''Río Bravo''' (or, more formally, the '''Río Bravo del Norte''') in [[Mexico]], the [[river]] rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border.

The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance. (''See'' [http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf] ''(PDF)''.)

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Laredo, Texas]], and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros|Matamoros, Tamaulipas]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]]. 

Use of the water of the Rio Grande is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas; and a treaty between the United States and Mexico. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Since the summer of 2003, much of the river from Albuquerque to the [[Big Bend National Park]] has been dry.

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Laredo, Texas]], and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros|Matamoros, Tamaulipas]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]]. 

Use of the water of the Rio Grande is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas; and a treaty between the United States and Mexico. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Since the summer of 2003, much of the river from Albuquerque to the [[Big Bend National Park]] has been dry. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct.

The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 1147 [[meter|m]] (3762 feet) above [[sea level]]. In New Mexico the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]].  From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower Rio Grande [[Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]].  But about [[geologic time|1 million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

Known as the '''Rio Grande''' in the [[United States]] and as the '''Río Bravo''' (or, more formally, the '''Río Bravo del Norte''') in [[Mexico]], the [[river]] rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border.

The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]].

Known as the '''Rio Grande''' in the [[United States]] and as the '''Río Bravo''' (or, more formally, the '''Río Bravo del Norte''') in [[Mexico]], the [[river]] rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[U.S.-Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]].

The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance.

[[Image:Riogrande.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The Rio Grande flowing in [[Big Bend National Park]]]]

Known as the '''Rio Grande''' in the [[United States]] and as the '''Río Bravo''' (or, more formally, the '''Río Bravo del Norte''') in [[Mexico]], the [[river]], 3034 km long, rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[U.S.-Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]].

The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance. (''See'' [http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf] ''(PDF)''.)

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Laredo, Texas]], and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros|Matamoros, Tamaulipas]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]].

Use of the water of the Rio Grande is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas; and a treaty between the United States and Mexico.

[[Image:Riogrande.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The Rio Grande flowing in [[Big Bend National Park]]]]

Known as the '''Rio Grande''' in the [[United States]] and as the '''Río Bravo''' (or, more formally, the '''Río Bravo del Norte''') in [[Mexico]], the [[river]], 3034 km long, rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[U.S.-Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]].

The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance.

[[Image:Riogrande.jpg|300px|thumb|right|The Rio Grande flowing in [[Big Bend National Park]]]]

Known as the '''Rio Grande''' in the [[United States]] and as the '''Río Bravo''' (or, more formally, the '''Río Bravo del Norte''') in [[Mexico]], the [[river]], 3034 km long, rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[U.S.-Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]]. A major tributary, Rio Conchos,enters at Presidio, below El Paso and supplies most of the water in the 1000 miles Texas border segment.


The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance. (''See'' [http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf] ''(PDF)''.)

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Laredo, Texas]], and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]].

A major tributary, Rio Conchos,enters at Presidio, below El Paso and supplies most of the water in the 1000 miles Texas border segment.

The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance. (''See'' [http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf] ''(PDF)''.)

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Laredo, Texas]], and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]]. 

The US and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commision. 

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. In times of severe drought the section from El Paso downstream through Big Bend National Park has been dry. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 
[[Image:Riogrande_watershed.png|right|Map of the Rio Grande Watershed]]
The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 1147 [[meter|m]] (3762 feet) above [[sea level]]. In New Mexico the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]].  From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower Rio Grande [[Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]].  But about [[geologic time|1 million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 1147 [[meter|m]] (3762 feet) above [[sea level]]. In New Mexico the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]].  From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower Rio Grande [[Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]].  But about [[geologic time|1 million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

A major tributary, Rio Conchos,enters at Presidio, below El Paso and supplies most of the water in the 1000 miles Texas border segment.

The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance. (''See'' [http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf] ''(PDF)''.)

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Laredo, Texas]], and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]].

[[Image:Matamoros008.JPG|300px|thumb|right|The Rio Grande in its lower course, between [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]] and [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]]]]

Known as the '''Rio Grande''' in the [[United States]] and as the '''Río Bravo''' (or, more formally, the '''Río Bravo del Norte''') in [[Mexico]], the [[river]], 3034 km long, rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[U.S.-Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]]. A major tributary, Rio Conchos,enters at Presidio, below El Paso and supplies most of the water in the 1000 miles Texas border segment.

The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance. (''See'' [http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf] ''(PDF)''.)

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Laredo, Texas]], and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]]. 

The US and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commision. 

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. In times of severe drought the section from El Paso downstream through Big Bend National Park has been dry. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 
[[Image:Riogrande_watershed.png|right|Map of the Rio Grande Watershed]]
The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 1147 [[meter|m]] (3762 feet) above [[sea level]]. In New Mexico the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]].  From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower Rio Grande [[Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

Known as the '''Rio Grande''' in the [[United States]] and as the '''Río Bravo''' (or, more formally, the '''Río Bravo del Norte''') in [[Mexico]], the [[river]], 3034 km long, rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[U.S.-Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]]. A major tributary, Rio Conchos,enters at Presidio, below El Paso and supplies most of the water in the 1000 miles Texas border segment.
This river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance. (''See'' [http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf] ''(PDF)''.)

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Laredo, Texas]], and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]]. 

The US and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission. 

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. In times of severe drought the section from El Paso downstream through Big Bend National Park has been dry. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 
[[Image:Riogrande_watershed.png|right|Map of the Rio Grande Watershed]]
The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 1147 [[meter|m]] (3762 feet) above [[sea level]]. In New Mexico the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]].  From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower Rio Grande [[Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]].  But about [[geologic time|1 million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 1147 [[meter|m]] (3762 feet) above [[sea level]]. In New Mexico the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]].  From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower Rio Grande [[Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]].  But about [[geologic time|1 million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

Known as the '''Rio Grande''' in the [[United States]] and as the '''Río Bravo''' (or, more formally, the '''Río Bravo del Norte''') in [[Mexico]], the [[river]], 3034 km long, rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[U.S.-Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]]. A major tributary, Rio Conchos,enters at Presidio, below El Paso and supplies most of the water in the 1000 miles Texas border segment.

The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance. (''See'' [http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf] ''(PDF)''.)

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Laredo, Texas]], and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]]. 

The US and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission. 

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. In times of severe drought the section from El Paso downstream through Big Bend National Park has been dry.

The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]].  But about [[geologic time|1 million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

The Rio Grande was designated as one of the [[American Heritage Rivers]] in 1997.

[[Image:Matamoros008.JPG|300px|thumb|right|The Rio Grande in its lower course, between [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]] and [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]]]]

Known as the '''Rio Grande''' in the [[United States]] and as the '''Río Bravo''' (or, more formally, the '''Río Bravo del Norte''') in [[Mexico]], the [[river]], 3,034 [[kilometer|km]] (1,885 [[mile|mi]]) long, rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[U.S.-Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]]. A major tributary, Rio Conchos,enters at Presidio, below El Paso and supplies most of the water in the 1000 miles {{fact}} Texas border segment.

The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance. (''See'' [http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf] ''(PDF)''.)

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Laredo, Texas]], and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]]. 

The US and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission. 

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. In times of severe drought the section from El Paso downstream through Big Bend National Park has been dry. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 
[[Image:Riogrande_watershed.png|right|Map of the Rio Grande Watershed]]
The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 1147 [[meter|m]] (3762 feet) above [[sea level]]. In New Mexico the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]].  From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower Rio Grande [[Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.

[[Image:Matamoros008.JPG|300px|thumb|right|The Rio Grande in its lower course, between [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]] and [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]]]]

Known as the '''Rio Grande''' in the [[United States]] and as the '''Río Bravo''' (or, more formally, the '''Río Bravo del Norte''') in [[Mexico]], the [[river]], 3,034 [[kilometer|km]] (1,885 [[mile|mi]]) long, rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[U.S.-Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]]. A major tributary, Rio Conchos,enters at Presidio, below El Paso and supplies most of the water in the 2,019 km (1,254 mi) Texas border segment.

The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance. (''See'' [http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf] ''(PDF)''.)

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Laredo, Texas]], and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]]. 

The US and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission. 

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. In times of severe drought the section from El Paso downstream through Big Bend National Park has been dry. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 
[[Image:Riogrande_watershed.png|right|Map of the Rio Grande Watershed]]
The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 1147 [[meter|m]] (3762 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) above [[sea level]]. In New Mexico the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]].  From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower [[Rio Grande Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]].  But about [[geologic time|1 million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

The Rio Grande was designated as one of the [[American Heritage Rivers]] in 1997.

[[Image:Matamoros008.JPG|300px|thumb|right|The Rio Grande in its lower course, between [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]] and [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]]]]

Known as the '''Rio Grande''' in the [[United States]] and as the '''Río Bravo''' (or, more formally, the '''Río Bravo del Norte''') in [[Mexico]], the [[river]], 3,034 [[kilometer|km]] (1,885 [[mile|mi]]) long, rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[U.S.-Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]]. A major tributary, Rio Conchos,enters at Presidio, below El Paso and supplies most of the water in the 2,019 km (1,254 mi) Texas border segment.

The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance. (''See'' [http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf] ''(PDF)''.)

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Laredo, Texas]], and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]]. 

The US and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission. 

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. In times of severe drought the section from El Paso downstream through Big Bend National Park has been dry. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 
[[Image:Riogrande_watershed.png|right|Map of the Rio Grande Watershed]]
The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 1147 [[meter|m]] (3762 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]]) above [[sea level]]. In New Mexico the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]].  From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower [[Rio Grande Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

Known as the '''Rio Grande''' in the [[United States]] and as the '''Río Bravo''' (or, more formally, the '''Río Bravo del Norte''') in [[Mexico]], the [[river]], 3,034 [[kilometer|km]] (1,885 [[mile|mi]]) long, rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[U.S.-Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]].

The US and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission.  The most notable of these were signed in 1906 and 1944. 

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Because of both drought and overuse the section from El Paso downstream through Ojinaga was recently tagged &quot;The Forgotten River&quot; by those wishing to bring attention to the river's deteriorated condition. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct.

Known as the '''Rio Grande''' in the [[United States]] and as the '''Río Bravo''' (or, more formally, the '''Río Bravo del Norte''') in [[Mexico]], the [[river]], 1,885 [[mile|mi]] (3,034 [[kilometer|km]]) long, rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[U.S.-Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]]. A major tributary, Rio Conchos,enters at Presidio, below El Paso and supplies most of the water in the 1,254 mi (2,019 km) Texas border segment.

The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance. (''See'' [http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf] ''(PDF)''.)

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Laredo, Texas]], Presidio, Texas and Ojinaga, Chihuahua; and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]]. 

The US and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission.  The most notable of these were signed in 1906 and 1944. 

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Because of both drought and overuse the section from El Paso downstream through Ojinaga was recently tagged &quot;The Forgotten River&quot; by those wishing to bring attention to the river's deteriorated condition. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 
[[Image:Riogrande_watershed.png|right|Map of the Rio Grande Watershed]]
The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 3762 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]] (1147 [[meter|m]]) above [[sea level]]. In New Mexico, the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]].  From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower [[Rio Grande Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]].  But about [[geologic time|1 million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

The Rio Grande was designated as one of the [[American Heritage Rivers]] in 1997.

The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 3762 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]] (1147 [[meter|m]]) above [[sea level]]. In New Mexico, the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]].  From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower [[Rio Grande Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]].  But about [[geologic time|1 million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

The Rio Grande was designated as one of the [[American Heritage Rivers]] in 1997.

[[Image:Matamoros008.JPG|300px|thumb|right|The Rio Grande in its lower course, between [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]] and [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]]]]

Known as the '''Rio Grande''' in the [[United States]] and as the '''Río Bravo''' (or, more formally, the '''Río Bravo del Norte''') in [[Mexico]], the [[river]], 1,885 [[mile|mi]] (3,034 [[kilometer|km]]) long, rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[U.S.-Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]]. A major tributary, Rio Conchos,enters at Presidio, below El Paso and supplies most of the water in the 1,254 mi (2,019 km) Texas border segment.

The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance. (''See'' [http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf] ''(PDF)''.)

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Laredo, Texas]], Presidio, Texas and Ojinaga, Chihuahua; and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]]. 

The US and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission.  The most notable of these were signed in 1906 and 1944. 

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Because of both drought and overuse the section from El Paso downstream through Ojinaga was recently tagged &quot;The Forgotten River&quot; by those wishing to bring attention to the river's deteriorated condition. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct.

Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]]. 

The US and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission.  The most notable of these were signed in 1906 and 1944. 

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Because of both drought and overuse the section from El Paso downstream through Ojinaga was recently tagged &quot;The Forgotten River&quot; by those wishing to bring attention to the river's deteriorated condition. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 
[[Image:Riogrande_watershed.png|right|Map of the Rio Grande Watershed]]
The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 3762 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]] (1147 [[meter|m]]) above [[sea level]]. In New Mexico, the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]].  From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower [[Rio Grande Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]].  But about [[geologic time|1 million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

The Rio Grande was designated as one of the [[American Heritage Rivers]] in 1997. 

==Names and Pronunciation==
''Río Grande'' is [[Spanish]] for &quot;Great River&quot; and ''Río Grande del Norte'' means &quot;Great Northern River&quot; (literally &quot;Great River of the North&quot;). Rio Grande is pronounced either /ree-oh grænd/ or /ree-oh grænd-ee/ (where the last syllable of &quot;grand&quot; rhymes with the American pronunciation of &quot;hand&quot;) by English speakers. The phrase &quot;Rio Grande River&quot; is redundant.

Known as the '''Rio Grande''' in the [[United States]] and as the '''Río Bravo''' (or, more formally, the '''Río Bravo del Norte''') in [[Mexico]], the [[river]], 1,885 [[mile|mi]] (3,034 [[kilometer|km]]) long, rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[U.S.-Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]]. A major tributary, Rio Conchos,enters at Presidio, below El Paso and supplies most of the water in the 1,254 mi (2,019 km) Texas border segment.

The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance.

[[Image:Riogrande.jpg|thumb|The Rio Grande flowing in [[Big Bend National Park]]]]
[[Image:Matamoros008.JPG|thumb|The Rio Grande in its lower course, between [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]] and [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]]]]

Known as the '''Rio Grande''' in the [[United States]] and as the '''Río Bravo''' (or, more formally, the '''Río Bravo del Norte''') in [[Mexico]], the [[river]], 1,885 [[mile|mi]] (3,034 [[kilometer|km]]) long, rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[U.S.-Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]]. A major tributary, Rio Conchos, enters at Presidio, below El Paso and supplies most of the water in the 1,254 mi (2,019 km) Texas border segment.

The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance. (''See'' [http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf] ''(PDF)''.)

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Laredo, Texas]], Presidio, Texas and Ojinaga, Chihuahua; and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]]. 

The US and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission.  The most notable of these were signed in 1906 and 1944. 

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Because of both drought and overuse the section from El Paso downstream through Ojinaga was recently tagged &quot;The Forgotten River&quot; by those wishing to bring attention to the river's deteriorated condition. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 

[[Image:Riogrande_watershed.png|thumb|Map of the Rio Grande Watershed]]
The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 3762 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]] (1147 [[meter|m]]) above [[sea level]]. In New Mexico, the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]].  From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower [[Rio Grande Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]].  But about [[geologic time|1 million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

The Rio Grande was designated as one of the [[American Heritage Rivers]] in 1997. 

==Names and Pronunciation==
''Río Grande'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;Great River&quot; and ''Río Grande del Norte'' means &quot;Great Northern River&quot; (literally &quot;Great River of the North&quot;). Rio Grande is pronounced either /ree-oh grænd/ or /ree-oh grænd-ee/ (where the last syllable of &quot;grand&quot; rhymes with the American pronunciation of &quot;hand&quot;) by English speakers. The phrase &quot;Rio Grande River&quot; is redundant.

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Laredo, Texas]], Presidio, Texas and Ojinaga, Chihuahua; and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]]. 

The US and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission.  The most notable of these were signed in 1906 and 1944. 

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Because of both drought and overuse the section from El Paso downstream through Ojinaga was recently tagged &quot;The Forgotten River&quot; by those wishing to bring attention to the river's deteriorated condition. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 

[[Image:Riogrande_watershed.png|thumb|Map of the Rio Grande Watershed]]
The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 3762 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]] (1147 [[meter|m]]) above [[sea level]]. In New Mexico, the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]].  From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower [[Rio Grande Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]].  But about [[geologic time|1 million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

The Rio Grande was designated as one of the [[American Heritage Rivers]] in 1997. 

==Names and Pronunciation==
''Río Grande'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;Great River&quot; and ''Río Grande del Norte'' means &quot;Great Northern River&quot; (literally &quot;Great River of the North&quot;). Rio Grande is pronounced either /ree-oh grænd/ or /ree-oh grænd-ee/ (where the last syllable of &quot;grand&quot; rhymes with the American pronunciation of &quot;hand&quot;) by English speakers. The phrase &quot;Rio Grande River&quot; is redundant.

Known as the '''Rio Grande''' in the [[United States]] and as the '''Río Bravo''' (or, more formally, the '''Río Bravo del Norte''') in [[Mexico]], the [[river]], 1,885 [[mile|mi]] (3,034 [[kilometer|km]]) long, rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[U.S.-Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]]. A major tributary, Rio Conchos, enters at Presidio, below El Paso and supplies most of the water in the 1,254 mi (2,019 km) Texas border segment.

The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]].  But about [[geologic time|1 million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

The Rio Grande was designated as one of the [[American Heritage Rivers]] in 1997. 

==Names and Pronunciation==
''Río Grande'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;Great River&quot; and ''Río Grande del Norte'' means &quot;Great Northern River&quot; (literally &quot;Great River of the North&quot;). Rio Grande is pronounced either /ree-oh grænd/ or /ree-oh grænd-ee/ (where the last syllable of &quot;grand&quot; rhymes with the American pronunciation of &quot;hand&quot;) by English speakers. The phrase &quot;Rio Grande River&quot; is redundant.

Known as the '''Rio Grande''' in the [[United States]] and as the '''Río Bravo''' (or, more formally, the '''Río Bravo del Norte''') in [[Mexico]], the [[river]], 1,885 [[mile|mi]] (3,034 [[kilometer|km]]) long, is the 4th longest river in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgs&quot;&gt;{{cite paper

It rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[U.S.-Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]]. A major tributary, Rio Conchos, enters from Mexico at Presidio, below El Paso and supplies most of the water in the 1,254 mi (2,019 km) Texas border segment.

The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance. (''See'' [http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf] ''(PDF)''.)

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Laredo, Texas]], [[Presidio, Texas]] and [[Ojinaga, Chihuahua]]; and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]]. 

The US and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission.  The most notable of these were signed in 1906 and 1944. 

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Because of both drought and overuse the section from El Paso downstream through [[Ojinaga]] was recently tagged &quot;The Forgotten River&quot; by those wishing to bring attention to the river's deteriorated condition. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct.

The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 3762 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]] (1147 [[meter|m]]) above [[sea level]].

Known as the '''Rio Grande''' in the [[United States]] and as the '''Río Bravo''' (or, more formally, the '''Río Bravo del Norte''') in [[Mexico]], the [[river]], 1,885 [[mile|mi]] (3,034 [[kilometer|km]]) long, is the 4th longest river in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgs&quot;&gt;{{cite paper

==Description==
It rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[U.S.-Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]]. A major tributary, Rio Conchos, enters from Mexico at Presidio, below El Paso and supplies most of the water in the 1,254 mi (2,019 km) Texas border segment.

[[Image:Riogrande_watershed.png|thumb|left|Map of the Rio Grande Watershed]]The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance. (''See'' [http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf] ''(PDF)''.)

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Laredo, Texas]], [[Presidio, Texas]] and [[Ojinaga, Chihuahua]]; and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]]. 

The US and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission.  The most notable of these were signed in 1906 and 1944. 

[[Image:Matamoros008.JPG|thumb|300px|The Rio Grande in its lower course, between [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]] and [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]]]]

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Because of both drought and overuse the section from El Paso downstream through [[Ojinaga]] was recently tagged &quot;The Forgotten River&quot; by those wishing to bring attention to the river's deteriorated condition. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 

The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 3762 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]] (1147 [[meter|m]]) above [[sea level]]. In New Mexico, the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]].  From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower [[Rio Grande Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]].  But about [[geologic time|1 million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

==Description==
It rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[U.S.-Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]]. A major tributary, Rio Conchos, enters from Mexico at Presidio, below El Paso and supplies most of the water in the 1,254 mi (2,019 km) Texas border segment.

[[Image:Riogrande_watershed.png|thumb|left|Map of the Rio Grande Watershed]]The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance. (''See'' [http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf] ''(PDF)''.)

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Presidio, Texas]] and [[Ojinaga, Chihuahua]]; [[Laredo, Texas]] and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]]. 

The US and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission.  The most notable of these were signed in 1906 and 1944. 

[[Image:Matamoros008.JPG|thumb|300px|The Rio Grande in its lower course, between [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]] and [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]]]]

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Because of both drought and overuse the section from El Paso downstream through [[Ojinaga]] was recently tagged &quot;The Forgotten River&quot; by those wishing to bring attention to the river's deteriorated condition. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 

The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 3762 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]] (1147 [[meter|m]]) above [[sea level]]. In New Mexico, the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]].  From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower [[Rio Grande Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]].  But about [[geologic time|1 million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

The Rio Grande was designated as one of the [[American Heritage Rivers]] in 1997.

==Names and pronunciation==
''Río Grande'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;Big River&quot; and ''Río Grande del Norte'' means &quot;Great Northern River&quot; (literally &quot;Great River of the North&quot;). Rio Grande is pronounced either /ree-oh grænd/ or /ree-oh grænd-ee/ (where the last syllable of &quot;grand&quot; rhymes with the American pronunciation of &quot;hand&quot;) by English speakers. The phrase &quot;Rio Grande River&quot; is redundant.

Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]].  But about [[geologic time|1 million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

The Rio Grande was designated as one of the [[American Heritage Rivers]] in 1997.

==Names and pronunciation==
''Río Grande'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;Big River&quot; and ''Río Grande del Norte'' means &quot;Great Northern River&quot; (literally &quot;Great River of the North&quot;). Rio Grande is pronounced either /ree-oh grænd/ or /ree-oh grænd-ee/ (where the last syllable of &quot;grand&quot; rhymes with the American pronunciation of &quot;hand&quot;) by English speakers. The phrase &quot;Rio Grande River&quot; is redundant.

Known as the '''Rio Grande''' in the [[United States]] and as the '''Río Bravo''' (or, more formally, the '''Río Bravo del Norte''') in [[Mexico]], the [[river]], 1,885 [[mile|mi]] (3,034 [[kilometer|km]]) long, is the fourth longest river in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgs&quot;&gt;{{cite paper

==Description==
It rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[U.S.-Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]]. A major tributary, Rio Conchos, enters from Mexico at Presidio, below El Paso and supplies most of the water in the 1,254 mi (2,019 km) Texas border segment. Other known tributaries include the [[Pecos River|Pecos]] and the smaller [[Devils River (Texas)|Devils]], which join the Rio Grande on the site of [[Amistad Dam]]. Despite its name and length, the Rio Grande is not navigable at all by oceangoing ships, nor are there smaller craft using it as a route.

[[Image:Riogrande_watershed.png|thumb|left|Map of the Rio Grande Watershed]]The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance. (''See'' [http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf] ''(PDF)''.)

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Presidio, Texas]] and [[Ojinaga, Chihuahua]]; [[Laredo, Texas]] and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]]. 

The US and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission.  The most notable of these were signed in 1906 and 1944. 

[[Image:Matamoros008.JPG|thumb|300px|The Rio Grande in its lower course, between [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]] and [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]]]]

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Because of both drought and overuse the section from El Paso downstream through [[Ojinaga]] was recently tagged &quot;The Forgotten River&quot; by those wishing to bring attention to the river's deteriorated condition. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 

The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 3762 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]] (1147 [[meter|m]]) above [[sea level]]. In New Mexico, the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]].  From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower [[Rio Grande Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]].  But about [[geologic time|1 million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

==Description==
It rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[U.S.-Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]]. A major tributary, Rio Conchos, enters from Mexico at Presidio, below El Paso and supplies most of the water in the 1,254 mi (2,019 km) Texas border segment. Other known tributaries include the [[Pecos River|Pecos]] and the smaller [[Devils River (Texas)|Devils]], which join the Rio Grande on the site of [[Amistad Reservoir|Amistad Dam]]. Despite its name and length, the Rio Grande is not navigable at all by oceangoing ships, nor are there smaller craft using it as a route.

[[Image:Riogrande_watershed.png|thumb|left|Map of the Rio Grande Watershed]]The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance. (''See'' [http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf] ''(PDF)''.)

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Presidio, Texas]] and [[Ojinaga, Chihuahua]]; [[Laredo, Texas]] and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]]. 

The US and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission.  The most notable of these were signed in 1906 and 1944. 

[[Image:Matamoros008.JPG|thumb|300px|The Rio Grande in its lower course, between [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]] and [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]]]]

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Because of both drought and overuse the section from El Paso downstream through [[Ojinaga]] was recently tagged &quot;The Forgotten River&quot; by those wishing to bring attention to the river's deteriorated condition. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 

The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 3762 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]] (1147 [[meter|m]]) above [[sea level]]. In New Mexico, the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]].  From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower [[Rio Grande Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]].  But about [[geologic time|1 million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

The Rio Grande was designated as one of the [[American Heritage Rivers]] in 1997.

==Names and pronunciation==
''Río Grande'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;Big River&quot; and ''Río Grande del Norte'' means &quot;Great Northern River&quot; (literally &quot;Great River of the North&quot;). Rio Grande is pronounced either /ree-oh grænd/ or /ree-oh grænd-ee/ (where the last syllable of &quot;grand&quot; rhymes with the American pronunciation of &quot;hand&quot;) by English speakers. The phrase &quot;Rio Grande River&quot; is redundant.

==Description==
It rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[U.S.-Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]]. A major tributary, Rio Conchos, enters from Mexico at Presidio, below El Paso and supplies most of the water in the 1,254 mi (2,019 km) Texas border segment. Other known tributaries include the [[Pecos River|Pecos]] and the smaller [[Devils River (Texas)|Devils]], which join the Rio Grande on the site of [[Amistad Reservoir|Amistad Dam]]. Despite its name and length, the Rio Grande is not navigable at all by oceangoing ships, nor are there smaller craft using it as a route.

[[Image:Riogrande_watershed.png|thumb|left|Map of the Rio Grande Watershed]]The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance. (''See'' [http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf] ''(PDF)''.)

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Presidio, Texas]] and [[Ojinaga, Chihuahua]]; [[Laredo, Texas]] and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]]. 

The ASS and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission.  The most notable of these were signed in 1906 and 1944. 

[[Image:Matamoros008.JPG|thumb|300px|The Rio Grande in its lower course, between [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]] and [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]]]]

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Because of both drought and overuse the section from El Paso downstream through [[Ojinaga]] was recently tagged &quot;The Forgotten River&quot; by those wishing to bring attention to the river's deteriorated condition. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 

The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 3762 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]] (1147 [[meter|m]]) above [[sea level]]. In New Mexico, the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]].  From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower [[Rio Grande Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]].  But about [[geologic time|1 million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

The Rio Grande was designated as one of the [[American Heritage Rivers]] in 1997.

==Names and pronunciation==
''Río Grande'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;Big River&quot; and ''Río Grande del Norte'' means &quot;Great Northern River&quot; (literally &quot;Great River of the North&quot;). Rio Grande is pronounced either /ree-oh grænd/ or /ree-oh grænd-ee/ (where the last syllable of &quot;grand&quot; rhymes with the American pronunciation of &quot;hand&quot;) by English speakers. The phrase &quot;Rio Grande River&quot; is redundant.

Known as the '''Rio Grande''' in the [[United States]] and as the '''Río Bravo''' (or, more formally, the '''Río Bravo del Norte''') in [[Mexico]], the [[river]], 1,885 [[mile|mi]] (3,034 [[kilometer|km]]) long, is the fourth longest river in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgs&quot;&gt;{{cite paper

==Description==
It rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[U.S.-Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]]. A major tributary, Rio Conchos, enters from Mexico at Presidio, below El Paso and supplies most of the water in the 1,254 mi (2,019 km) Texas border segment. Other known tributaries include the [[Pecos River|Pecos]] and the smaller [[Devils River (Texas)|Devils]], which join the Rio Grande on the site of [[Amistad Reservoir|Amistad Dam]]. Despite its name and length, the Rio Grande is not navigable at all by oceangoing ships, nor are there smaller craft using it as a route.

[[Image:Riogrande_watershed.png|thumb|left|Map of the Rio Grande Watershed]]The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance. (''See'' [http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf] ''(PDF)''.)

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Presidio, Texas]] and [[Ojinaga, Chihuahua]]; [[Laredo, Texas]] and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]]. 

The US and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission.  The most notable of these were signed in 1906 and 1944. 

[[Image:Matamoros008.JPG|thumb|300px|The Rio Grande in its lower course, between [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]] and [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]]]]

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Because of both drought and overuse the section from El Paso downstream through [[Ojinaga]] was recently tagged &quot;The Forgotten River&quot; by those wishing to bring attention to the river's deteriorated condition. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 

The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 3762 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]] (1147 [[meter|m]]) above [[sea level]].

==Description==
It rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[U.S.-Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]]. A major tributary, Rio Conchos, enters from Mexico at Presidio, below El Paso and supplies most of the water in the 1,254 mi (2,019 km) Texas border segment. Other known tributaries include the [[Pecos River|Pecos]] and the smaller [[Devils River (Texas)|Devils]], which join the Rio Grande on the site of [[Amistad Reservoir|Amistad Dam]]. Despite its name and length, the Rio Grande is not navigable at all by oceangoing ships, nor are there smaller craft using it as a route.

[[Image:Riogrande_watershed.png|thumb|left|Map of the Rio Grande Watershed]]The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance. (''See'' [http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf] ''(PDF)''.)

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Presidio, Texas]] and [[Ojinaga, Chihuahua]]; [[Laredo, Texas]] and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]]. 

The US and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission.  The most notable of these were signed in 1906 and 1944. 

[[Image:Matamoros008.JPG|thumb|300px|The Rio Grande in its lower course, between [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]] and [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]]]]

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Because of both drought and overuse the section from El Paso downstream through [[Ojinaga]] was recently tagged &quot;The Forgotten River&quot; by those wishing to bring attention to the river's deteriorated condition. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 

The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 3762 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]] (1147 [[meter|m]]) above [[sea level]]. In New Mexico, the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]].  From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower [[Rio Grande Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]].  But about [[geologic time|1 million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

The Rio Grande was designated as one of the [[American Heritage Rivers]] in 1997.

==Names and pronunciation==
''Río Grande'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;Big River&quot; and ''Río Grande del Norte'' means &quot;Great Northern River&quot; (literally &quot;Great River of the North&quot;). Rio Grande is pronounced either /ree-oh grænd/ or /ree-oh grænd-ee/ (where the last syllable of &quot;grand&quot; rhymes with the American pronunciation of &quot;hand&quot;) by English speakers. The phrase &quot;Rio Grande River&quot; is redundant.

The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]].  But about [[geologic time|1 million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

The Rio Grande was designated as one of the [[American Heritage Rivers]] in 1997.

==Names and pronunciation==
''Río Grande'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;Big River&quot; and ''Río Grande del Norte'' means &quot;Great Northern River&quot; (literally &quot;Great River of the North&quot;). Rio Grande is pronounced either /ree-oh grænd/ or /ree-oh grænd-ee/ (where the last syllable of &quot;grand&quot; rhymes with the American pronunciation of &quot;hand&quot;) by English speakers. The phrase &quot;Rio Grande River&quot; is redundant.

Known as the '''Rio Grande''' in the [[United States]] and as the '''Río Bravo''' (or, more formally, the '''Río Bravo del Norte''') in [[Mexico]], the [[river]], 1,885 [[mile|mi]] (3,034 [[kilometer|km]]) long, is the fourth longest river in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgs&quot;&gt;{{cite paper

==Description==
It rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[United States–Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]]. A major tributary, Rio Conchos, enters from Mexico at Presidio, below El Paso and supplies most of the water in the 1,254 mi (2,019 km) Texas border segment. Other known tributaries include the [[Pecos River|Pecos]] and the smaller [[Devils River (Texas)|Devils]], which join the Rio Grande on the site of [[Amistad Reservoir|Amistad Dam]]. Despite its name and length, the Rio Grande is not navigable at all by oceangoing ships, nor are there smaller craft using it as a route.

[[Image:Riogrande_watershed.png|thumb|left|Map of the Rio Grande Watershed]]The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance. (''See'' [http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf] ''(PDF)''.)

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Presidio, Texas]] and [[Ojinaga, Chihuahua]]; [[Laredo, Texas]] and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]]. 

The US and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission.  The most notable of these were signed in 1906 and 1944. 

[[Image:Matamoros008.JPG|thumb|300px|The Rio Grande in its lower course, between [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]] and [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]]]]

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Because of both drought and overuse the section from El Paso downstream through [[Ojinaga]] was recently tagged &quot;The Forgotten River&quot; by those wishing to bring attention to the river's deteriorated condition. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 

The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 3762 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]] (1147 [[meter|m]]) above [[sea level]]. In New Mexico, the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]].  From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower [[Rio Grande Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

==Description==
It rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[United States–Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]]. A major tributary, Rio Conchos, enters from Mexico at Presidio, below El Paso and supplies most of the water in the 1,254 mi (2,019 km) Texas border segment. Other known tributaries include the [[Pecos River|Pecos]] and the smaller [[Devils River (Texas)|Devils]], which join the Rio Grande on the site of [[Amistad Reservoir|Amistad Dam]]. Despite its name and length, the Rio Grande is not navigable at all by oceangoing ships, nor are there smaller craft using it as a route.

[[Image:Riogrande_watershed.png|thumb|left|Map of the Rio Grande Watershed]]The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance. (''See'' [http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf] ''(PDF)''.)

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Presidio, Texas]] and [[Ojinaga, Chihuahua]]; [[Laredo, Texas]] and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]]. 

The US and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission.  The most notable of these were signed in 1906 and 1944. 

[[Image:Matamoros008.JPG|thumb|300px|The Rio Grande in its lower course, between [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]] and [[Brownsville, Texas|Brownsville]]]]

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Because of both drought and overuse the section from El Paso downstream through [[Ojinaga]] was recently tagged &quot;The Forgotten River&quot; by those wishing to bring attention to the river's deteriorated condition. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 

The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 3762 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]] (1147 [[meter|m]]) above [[sea level]]. In New Mexico, the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]].  From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower [[Rio Grande Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]].  But about [[geologic time|1 million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

The Rio Grande was designated as one of the [[American Heritage Rivers]] in 1997.

==Names and pronunciation==
''Río Grande'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;Big River&quot; and ''Río Grande del Norte'' means &quot;Great Northern River&quot; (literally &quot;Great River of the North&quot;). Rio Grande is pronounced either /ree-oh grænd/ or /ree-oh grænd-ee/ (where the last syllable of &quot;grand&quot; rhymes with the American pronunciation of &quot;hand&quot;) by English speakers. The phrase &quot;Rio Grande River&quot; is redundant.

==Description==
It rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[United States–Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]]. A major tributary, Rio Conchos, enters from Mexico at Presidio, below El Paso and supplies most of the water in the 1,254 mi (2,019 km) Texas border segment. Other known tributaries include the [[Pecos River|Pecos]] and the smaller [[Devils River (Texas)|Devils]], which join the Rio Grande on the site of [[Amistad Reservoir|Amistad Dam]]. Despite its name and length, the Rio Grande is not navigable at all by oceangoing ships, nor are there smaller craft using it as a route.

The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf &quot;The UGRR on the Rio Grande&quot;]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Presidio, Texas]] and [[Ojinaga, Chihuahua]]; [[Laredo, Texas]] and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]].
[[Image:Riogrande.jpg|thumb|300px|The Rio Grande flowing in [[Big Bend National Park]]]]
The US and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission.  The most notable of these were signed in 1906 and 1944. 

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Because of both drought and overuse the section from El Paso downstream through [[Ojinaga]] was recently tagged &quot;The Forgotten River&quot; by those wishing to bring attention to the river's deteriorated condition. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 

The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 3762 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]] (1147 [[meter|m]]) above [[sea level]]. In New Mexico, the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]]. [[Image:Rio Grande Creede.jpg|thumb|300px|The Upper Rio Grande near [[Creede, Colorado]]]] From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower [[Rio Grande Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]].  But about one [[mya (unit)|million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

The Rio Grande was designated as one of the [[American Heritage Rivers]] in 1997.

''Río Grande'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;Big River&quot; and ''Río Grande del Norte'' means &quot;Great Northern River&quot; (literally &quot;Great River of the North&quot;).

==Description==
It rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[United States–Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]]. A major tributary, Rio Conchos, enters from Mexico at Presidio, below El Paso and supplies most of the water in the 1,254 mi (2,019 km) Texas border segment. Other known tributaries include the [[Pecos River|Pecos]] and the smaller [[Devils River (Texas)|Devils]], which join the Rio Grande on the site of [[Amistad Reservoir|Amistad Dam]]. Despite its name and length, the Rio Grande is not navigable at all by oceangoing ships, nor are there smaller craft using it as a route.

The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf &quot;The UGRR on the Rio Grande&quot;]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Presidio, Texas]] and [[Ojinaga, Chihuahua]]; [[Laredo, Texas]] and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]].
[[Image:Riogrande.jpg|thumb|300px|The Rio Grande flowing in [[Big Bend National Park]]]]
The US and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission.  The most notable of these were signed in 1906 and 1944. 

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Because of both drought and overuse the section from El Paso downstream through [[Ojinaga]] was recently tagged &quot;The Forgotten River&quot; by those wishing to bring attention to the river's deteriorated condition. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 

The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 3762 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]] (1147 [[meter|m]]) above [[sea level]]. In New Mexico, the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]]. [[Image:Rio Grande Creede.jpg|thumb|300px|The Upper Rio Grande near [[Creede, Colorado]]]] From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower [[Rio Grande Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]].  But about one [[mya (unit)|million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

The Rio Grande was designated as one of the [[American Heritage Rivers]] in 1997.

==Names and pronunciation==
''Río Grande'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;Big River&quot; and ''Río Grande del Norte'' means &quot;Great Northern River&quot; (literally &quot;Great River of the North&quot;). Rio Grande is pronounced either /ree-oh grænd/ or /ree-oh grænd-ee/ (where the last syllable of &quot;grand&quot; rhymes with the American pronunciation of &quot;hand&quot;) by English speakers. The phrase &quot;Rio Grande River&quot; is redundant.

''Río Grande'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;Big River&quot; and ''Río Grande del Norte'' means &quot;Great Northern River&quot; (literally &quot;Great River of the North&quot;). Rio Grande is pronounced either /ree-oh grænd/ or /ree-oh grænd-ee/ (where the last syllable of &quot;grand&quot; rhymes with the American pronunciation of &quot;hand&quot;) by English speakers. The phrase &quot;Rio Grande River&quot; is redundant.

==Description==
It rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[United States–Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]]. A major tributary, Rio Conchos, enters from Mexico at Presidio, below El Paso and supplies most of the water in the 1,254 mi (2,019 km) Texas border segment. Other known tributaries include the [[Pecos River|Pecos]] and the smaller [[Devils River (Texas)|Devils]], which join the Rio Grande on the site of [[Amistad Reservoir|Amistad Dam]]. Despite its name and length, the Rio Grande is not navigable at all by oceangoing ships, nor are there smaller craft using it as a route. In fact it is barely navigable at all.

The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf &quot;The UGRR on the Rio Grande&quot;]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Presidio, Texas]] and [[Ojinaga, Chihuahua]]; [[Laredo, Texas]] and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]].
[[Image:Riogrande.jpg|thumb|300px|The Rio Grande flowing in [[Big Bend National Park]]]]
The US and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission.  The most notable of these were signed in 1906 and 1944. 

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Because of both drought and overuse the section from El Paso downstream through [[Ojinaga]] was recently tagged &quot;The Forgotten River&quot; by those wishing to bring attention to the river's deteriorated condition. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 

The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 3762 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]] (1147 [[meter|m]]) above [[sea level]]. In New Mexico, the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]]. [[Image:Rio Grande Creede.jpg|thumb|300px|The Upper Rio Grande near [[Creede, Colorado]]]] From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower [[Rio Grande Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]].  But about one [[mya (unit)|million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

The Rio Grande was designated as one of the [[American Heritage Rivers]] in 1997.

==Names and pronunciation==
''Río Grande'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;Big River&quot; and ''Río Grande del Norte'' means &quot;Great Northern River&quot; (literally &quot;Great River of the North&quot;). Rio Grande is pronounced either /ree-oh grænd/ or /ree-oh grænd-ee/ (where the last syllable of &quot;grand&quot; rhymes with the American pronunciation of &quot;hand&quot;) by English speakers.

==Description==
It rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[United States–Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]]. A major tributary, Rio Conchos, enters from Mexico at Presidio, below El Paso and supplies most of the water in the 1,254 mi (2,019 km) Texas border segment. Other known tributaries include the [[Pecos River|Pecos]] and the smaller [[Devils River (Texas)|Devils]], which join the Rio Grande on the site of [[Amistad Reservoir|Amistad Dam]]. Despite its name and length, the Rio Grande is not navigable at all by oceangoing ships, nor are there smaller craft using it as a route. In fact it is barely navigable at all.

The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf &quot;The UGRR on the Rio Grande&quot;]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Presidio, Texas]] and [[Ojinaga, Chihuahua]]; [[Laredo, Texas]] and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]].
[[Image:Riogrande.jpg|thumb|300px|The Rio Grande flowing in [[Big Bend National Park]]]]
The US and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission.  The most notable of these were signed in 1906 and 1944. 

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Because of both drought and overuse the section from El Paso downstream through [[Ojinaga]] was recently tagged &quot;The Forgotten River&quot; by those wishing to bring attention to the river's deteriorated condition. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 

The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 3762 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]] (1147 [[meter|m]]) above [[sea level]]. In New Mexico, the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]]. [[Image:Rio Grande Creede.jpg|thumb|300px|The Upper Rio Grande near [[Creede, Colorado]]]] From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower [[Rio Grande Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]].  But about one [[mya (unit)|million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

The Rio Grande was designated as one of the [[American Heritage Rivers]] in 1997.

==Names and pronunciation==
''Río Grande'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;Big River&quot; and ''Río Grande del Norte'' means &quot;Great Northern River&quot; (literally &quot;Great River of the North&quot;). Rio Grande is pronounced either /ree-oh grænd/ or /ree-oh grænd-ee/ (where the last syllable of &quot;grand&quot; rhymes with the American pronunciation of &quot;hand&quot;) by English speakers. The phrase &quot;Rio Grande River&quot; is redundant.

In New Mexico, the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]]. [[Image:Rio Grande Creede.jpg|thumb|300px|The Upper Rio Grande near [[Creede, Colorado]]]] From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower [[Rio Grande Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]].  But about one [[mya (unit)|million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

The Rio Grande was designated as one of the [[American Heritage Rivers]] in 1997.

==Names and pronunciation==
''Río Grande'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;Big River&quot; and ''Río Grande del Norte'' means &quot;Great Northern River&quot; (literally &quot;Great River of the North&quot;). Rio Grande is pronounced either /ree-oh grænd/ or /ree-oh grænd-ee/ (where the last syllable of &quot;grand&quot; rhymes with the American pronunciation of &quot;hand&quot;) by English speakers. The phrase &quot;Rio Grande River&quot; is redundant.

==Description==
The Rio Grande rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[United States–Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]]. A major tributary, Rio Conchos, enters from Mexico at Presidio, below El Paso and supplies most of the water in the 1,254 mi (2,019 km) Texas border segment. Other known tributaries include the [[Pecos River|Pecos]] and the smaller [[Devils River (Texas)|Devils]], which join the Rio Grande on the site of [[Amistad Reservoir|Amistad Dam]]. Despite its name and length, the Rio Grande is not navigable at all by oceangoing ships, nor are there smaller craft using it as a route. In fact it is barely navigable at all.

The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf &quot;The UGRR on the Rio Grande&quot;]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Presidio, Texas]] and [[Ojinaga, Chihuahua]]; [[Laredo, Texas]] and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]].
[[Image:Riogrande.jpg|thumb|300px|The Rio Grande flowing in [[Big Bend National Park]]]]
The US and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission.  The most notable of these were signed in 1906 and 1944. 

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Because of both drought and overuse the section from El Paso downstream through [[Ojinaga]] was recently tagged &quot;The Forgotten River&quot; by those wishing to bring attention to the river's deteriorated condition. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 

The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 3762 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]] (1147 [[meter|m]]) above [[sea level]].

Known as the '''Rio Grande''' in the [[United States]] and as the '''Río Bravo''' (or, more formally, the '''Río Bravo del Norte''') in [[Mexico]], the [[river]], 1,885 [[mile|mi]] (3,034 [[kilometer|km]]) long, is the fourth longest river in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;usgs&quot;&gt;{{cite paper

==Description==
The Rio Grande rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[United States–Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]]. A major tributary, Rio Conchos, enters from Mexico at Presidio, below El Paso and supplies most of the water in the 1,254 mi (2,019 km) Texas border segment. Other known tributaries include the [[Pecos River|Pecos]] and the smaller [[Devils River (Texas)|Devils]], which join the Rio Grande on the site of [[Amistad Reservoir|Amistad Dam]]. Despite its name and length, the Rio Grande is not navigable at all by oceangoing ships, nor are there smaller craft using it as a route. In fact it is barely navigable at all.

The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf &quot;The UGRR on the Rio Grande&quot;]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Presidio, Texas]] and [[Ojinaga, Chihuahua]]; [[Laredo, Texas]] and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]].
[[Image:Riogrande.jpg|thumb|300px|The Rio Grande flowing in [[Big Bend National Park]]]]
The US and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission.  The most notable of these were signed in 1906 and 1944. 

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Because of both drought and overuse the section from El Paso downstream through [[Ojinaga]] was recently tagged &quot;The Forgotten River&quot; by those wishing to bring attention to the river's deteriorated condition. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 

The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 3762 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]] (1147 [[meter|m]]) above [[sea level]]. In New Mexico, the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]]. [[Image:Rio Grande Creede.jpg|thumb|300px|The Upper Rio Grande near [[Creede, Colorado]]]] From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower [[Rio Grande Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]].  But about one [[mya (unit)|million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

The Rio Grande was designated as one of the [[American Heritage Rivers]] in 1997.

==Names and pronunciation==
''Río Grande'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;Big River&quot; and ''Río Grande del Norte'' means &quot;Great Northern River&quot; (literally &quot;Great River of the North&quot;). Rio Grande is pronounced either /ɹioʊ gɹænd/ or /ɹioʊ gɹændi/ (where &quot;Grande&quot; is pronounced like the English word &quot;grand&quot;) by English speakers. Because &quot;río&quot; means &quot;river&quot; in Spanish, the phrase &quot;Rio Grande River&quot; is redundant.

The Rio Grande rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[United States–Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]]. A major tributary, Rio Conchos, enters from Mexico at Presidio, below El Paso and supplies most of the water in the 1,254 mi (2,019 km) Texas border segment. Other known tributaries include the [[Pecos River|Pecos]] and the smaller [[Devils River (Texas)|Devils]], which join the Rio Grande on the site of [[Amistad Reservoir|Amistad Dam]]. Despite its name and length, the Rio Grande is not navigable at all by oceangoing ships, nor are there smaller craft using it as a route. In fact it is barely navigable at all.

The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf &quot;The UGRR on the Rio Grande&quot;]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Presidio, Texas]] and [[Ojinaga, Chihuahua]]; [[Laredo, Texas]] and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]].
[[Image:Riogrande.jpg|thumb|300px|The Rio Grande flowing in [[Big Bend National Park]]]]
The US and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission.  The most notable of these were signed in 1906 and 1944. 

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Because of both drought and overuse the section from El Paso downstream through [[Ojinaga]] was recently tagged &quot;The Forgotten River&quot; by those wishing to bring attention to the river's deteriorated condition. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 

The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 3762 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]] (1147 [[meter|m]]) above [[sea level]]. In New Mexico, the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]]. [[Image:Rio Grande Creede.jpg|thumb|300px|The Upper Rio Grande near [[Creede, Colorado]]]] From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower [[Rio Grande Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]].  But about one [[mya (unit)|million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

The Rio Grande was designated as one of the [[American Heritage Rivers]] in 1997.

==Names and pronunciation==
''Río Grande'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;Big River&quot; and ''Río Grande del Norte'' means &quot;Great Northern River&quot; (literally &quot;Great River of the North&quot;). Rio Grande is pronounced either /ɹioʊ gɹænd/ or /ɹioʊ gɹændi/ (where &quot;Grande&quot; is pronounced like the English word &quot;grand&quot;) by English speakers. Because &quot;río&quot; means &quot;river&quot; in Spanish, the phrase &quot;Rio Grande River&quot; is redundant.

In New Mexico, the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]]. [[Image:Rio Grande Creede.jpg|thumb|300px|The Upper Rio Grande near [[Creede, Colorado]]]] From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower [[Rio Grande Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]].  But about one [[mya (unit)|million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

The Rio Grande was designated as one of the [[American Heritage Rivers]] in 1997.

==Names and pronunciation==
''Río Grande'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;Big River&quot; and ''Río Grande del Norte'' means &quot;Great Northern River&quot; (literally &quot;Great River of the North&quot;). Rio Grande is pronounced either /ɹioʊ gɹænd/ or /ɹioʊ gɹændi/ (where &quot;Grande&quot; is pronounced like the English word &quot;grand&quot;) by English speakers. Because &quot;río&quot; means &quot;river&quot; in Spanish, the phrase &quot;Rio Grande River&quot; is redundant.

==Description==
The river where wetbacks cross into america and cause problems for everybody rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[United States–Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]]. A major tributary, Rio Conchos, enters from Mexico at Presidio, below El Paso and supplies most of the water in the 1,254 mi (2,019 km) Texas border segment. Other known tributaries include the [[Pecos River|Pecos]] and the smaller [[Devils River (Texas)|Devils]], which join the Rio Grande on the site of [[Amistad Reservoir|Amistad Dam]]. Despite its name and length, the Rio Grande is not navigable at all by oceangoing ships, nor are there smaller craft using it as a route. In fact it is barely navigable at all.

The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf &quot;The UGRR on the Rio Grande&quot;]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Presidio, Texas]] and [[Ojinaga, Chihuahua]]; [[Laredo, Texas]] and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]].
[[Image:Riogrande.jpg|thumb|300px|The Rio Grande flowing in [[Big Bend National Park]]]]
The US and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission.  The most notable of these were signed in 1906 and 1944. 

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Because of both drought and overuse the section from El Paso downstream through [[Ojinaga]] was recently tagged &quot;The Forgotten River&quot; by those wishing to bring attention to the river's deteriorated condition. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct.

Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]].  But about one [[mya (unit)|million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

The Rio Grande was designated as one of the [[American Heritage Rivers]] in 1997.

==Names and pronunciation==
''Río Grande'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;Big River&quot; and ''Río Grande del Norte'' means &quot;Great Northern River&quot; (literally &quot;Great River of the North&quot;). Rio Grande is pronounced either /ɹioʊ gɹænd/ or /ɹioʊ gɹændi/ (where &quot;Grande&quot; is pronounced like the English word &quot;grand&quot;) by English speakers. Because &quot;río&quot; means &quot;river&quot; in Spanish, the phrase &quot;Rio Grande River&quot; is redundant.

==Description==
The Rio Grande rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[United States–Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]]. A major tributary, Rio Conchos, enters from Mexico at Presidio, below El Paso and supplies most of the water in the 1,254 mi (2,019 km) Texas border segment. Other known tributaries include the [[Pecos River|Pecos]] and the smaller [[Devils River (Texas)|Devils]], which join the Rio Grande on the site of [[Amistad Reservoir|Amistad Dam]]. Despite its name and length, the Rio Grande is not navigable at all by oceangoing ships, nor are there smaller craft using it as a route. In fact it is barely navigable at all.

The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf &quot;The UGRR on the Rio Grande&quot;]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Presidio, Texas]] and [[Ojinaga, Chihuahua]]; [[Laredo, Texas]] and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]].
[[Image:Riogrande.jpg|thumb|300px|The Rio Grande flowing in [[Big Bend National Park]]]]
The US and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission.  The most notable of these were signed in 1906 and 1944. 

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Because of both drought and overuse the section from El Paso downstream through [[Ojinaga]] was recently tagged &quot;The Forgotten River&quot; by those wishing to bring attention to the river's deteriorated condition. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 

The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 3762 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]] (1147 [[meter|m]]) above [[sea level]]. In New Mexico, the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]]. [[Image:Rio Grande Creede.jpg|thumb|300px|The Upper Rio Grande near [[Creede, Colorado]]]] From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower [[Rio Grande Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

==Description==
The Rio Grande rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[United States–Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]]. A major tributary, Rio Conchos, enters from Mexico at Presidio, below El Paso and supplies most of the water in the 1,254 mi (2,019 km) Texas border segment. Other known tributaries include the [[Pecos River|Pecos]] and the smaller [[Devils River (Texas)|Devils]], which join the Rio Grande on the site of [[Amistad Reservoir|Amistad Dam]]. Despite its name and length, the Rio Grande is not navigable at all by oceangoing ships, nor are there smaller craft using it as a route. In fact it is barely navigable at all.

The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf &quot;The UGRR on the Rio Grande&quot;]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Presidio, Texas]] and [[Ojinaga, Chihuahua]]; [[Laredo, Texas]] and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]].
[[Image:Riogrande.jpg|thumb|300px|The Rio Grande flowing in [[Big Bend National Park]]]]
The US and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission.  The most notable of these were signed in 1906 and 1944. 

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Because of both drought and overuse the section from El Paso downstream through [[Ojinaga]] was recently tagged &quot;The Forgotten River&quot; by those wishing to bring attention to the river's deteriorated condition. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 

The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 3762 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]] (1147 [[meter|m]]) above [[sea level]]. In New Mexico, the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]]. [[Image:Rio Grande Creede.jpg|thumb|300px|The Upper Rio Grande near [[Creede, Colorado]]]] From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower [[Rio Grande Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]].  But about one [[mya (unit)|million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

The Rio Grande was designated as one of the [[American Heritage Rivers]] in [[1997]].

==Names and pronunciation==
''Río Grande'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;Big River&quot; and ''Río Grande del Norte'' means &quot;Great Northern River&quot; (literally &quot;Great River of the North&quot;). Rio Grande is pronounced either /ɹioʊ gɹænd/ or /ɹioʊ gɹændi/ (where &quot;Grande&quot; is pronounced like the English word &quot;grand&quot;) by English speakers. Because &quot;río&quot; means &quot;river&quot; in Spanish, the phrase &quot;Rio Grande River&quot; is redundant.

==Description==
The Rio Grande rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[United States–Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]]. A major tributary, Rio Conchos, enters from Mexico at Presidio, below El Paso and supplies most of the water in the 1,254 mi (2,019 km) Texas border segment. Other known tributaries include the [[Pecos River|Pecos]] and the smaller [[Devils River (Texas)|Devils]], which join the Rio Grande on the site of [[Amistad Reservoir|Amistad Dam]]. Despite its name and length, the Rio Grande is not navigable at all by oceangoing ships, nor are there smaller craft using it as a route. In fact it is barely navigable at all.

The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf &quot;The UGRR on the Rio Grande&quot;]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Presidio, Texas]] and [[Ojinaga, Chihuahua]]; [[Laredo, Texas]] and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]].
[[Image:Riogrande.jpg|thumb|300px|The Rio Grande flowing in [[Big Bend National Park]]]]
The US and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission.  The most notable of these were signed in 1906 and 1944. 

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Because of both drought and overuse the section from El Paso downstream through [[Ojinaga]] was recently tagged &quot;The Forgotten River&quot; by those wishing to bring attention to the river's deteriorated condition. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 

The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 3762 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]] (1147 [[meter|m]]) above [[sea level]]. In New Mexico, the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]]. [[Image:Rio Grande Creede.jpg|thumb|300px|The Upper Rio Grande near [[Creede, Colorado]]]] From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower [[Rio Grande Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]].  But about one [[mya (unit)|million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

The Rio Grande was designated as one of the [[American Heritage Rivers]] in [[1997]].

==Names and pronunciation==
''Río Grande'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;Big River&quot; and ''Río Grande del Norte'' means &quot;Great Northern River&quot; (literally &quot;Great River of the North&quot;). Rio Grande is pronounced either /ɹioʊ gɹænd/ or /ɹioʊ gɹændi/ (where &quot;Grande&quot; is pronounced like the English word &quot;grand&quot;) by English speakers. Because &quot;río&quot; means &quot;river&quot; in Spanish, the phrase &quot;Rio Grande River&quot; is redundant.

==Description==
The Rio Grande rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of [[Colorado]], [[United States|USA]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[United States–Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]]. A major tributary, Rio Conchos, enters from Mexico at Presidio, below El Paso and supplies most of the water in the 1,254 mi (2,019 km) Texas border segment. Other known tributaries include the [[Pecos River|Pecos]] and the smaller [[Devils River (Texas)|Devils]], which join the Rio Grande on the site of [[Amistad Reservoir|Amistad Dam]]. Despite its name and length, the Rio Grande is not navigable at all by oceangoing ships, nor are there smaller craft using it as a route. In fact it is barely navigable at all.

The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf &quot;The UGRR on the Rio Grande&quot;]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Presidio, Texas]] and [[Ojinaga, Chihuahua]]; [[Laredo, Texas]] and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]].
[[Image:Riogrande.jpg|thumb|300px|The Rio Grande flowing in [[Big Bend National Park]]]]
The US and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission.  The most notable of these were signed in 1906 and 1944. 

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Because of both drought and overuse the section from El Paso downstream through [[Ojinaga]] was recently tagged &quot;The Forgotten River&quot; by those wishing to bring attention to the river's deteriorated condition. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 

The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 3762 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]] (1147 [[meter|m]]) above [[sea level]]. In New Mexico, the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]]. [[Image:Rio Grande Creede.jpg|thumb|300px|The Upper Rio Grande near [[Creede, Colorado]]]] From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower [[Rio Grande Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]].  But about one [[mya (unit)|million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

The Rio Grande was designated as one of the [[American Heritage Rivers]] in [[1997]].

==Names and pronunciation==
''Río Grande'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;Big River&quot; and ''Río Grande del Norte'' means &quot;Great Northern River&quot; (literally &quot;Great River of the North&quot;). Rio Grande is pronounced either /ɹioʊ gɹænd/ or /ɹioʊ gɹændi/ (where &quot;Grande&quot; is pronounced like the English word &quot;grand&quot;) by English speakers. Because &quot;río&quot; means &quot;river&quot; in Spanish, the phrase &quot;Rio Grande River&quot; is redundant.

Other known tributaries include the [[Pecos River|Pecos]] and the smaller [[Devils River (Texas)|Devils]], which join the Rio Grande on the site of [[Amistad Reservoir|Amistad Dam]]. Despite its name and length, the Rio Grande is not navigable at all by oceangoing ships, nor are there smaller craft using it as a route. In fact it is barely navigable at all.

The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf &quot;The UGRR on the Rio Grande&quot;]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Presidio, Texas]] and [[Ojinaga, Chihuahua]]; [[Laredo, Texas]] and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].  Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]].
[[Image:Riogrande.jpg|thumb|300px|The Rio Grande flowing in [[Big Bend National Park]]]]
The US and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission.  The most notable of these were signed in 1906 and 1944. 

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Because of both drought and overuse the section from El Paso downstream through [[Ojinaga]] was recently tagged &quot;The Forgotten River&quot; by those wishing to bring attention to the river's deteriorated condition. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 

The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 3762 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]] (1147 [[meter|m]]) above [[sea level]]. In New Mexico, the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]]. [[Image:Rio Grande Creede.jpg|thumb|300px|The Upper Rio Grande near [[Creede, Colorado]]]] From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower [[Rio Grande Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]].  But about one [[mya (unit)|million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

The Rio Grande was designated as one of the [[American Heritage Rivers]] in [[1997]].

==Names and pronunciation==
''Río Grande'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;Big River&quot; and ''Río Grande del Norte'' means &quot;Great Northern River&quot; (literally &quot;Great River of the North&quot;). Rio Grande is pronounced either /ɹioʊ gɹænd/ or /ɹioʊ gɹændi/ (where &quot;Grande&quot; is pronounced like the English word &quot;grand&quot;) by English speakers. Because &quot;río&quot; means &quot;river&quot; in Spanish, the phrase &quot;Rio Grande River&quot; is redundant.

Other notable border towns are the [[Texas]]/[[Coahuila]] pairings of [[Del Rio, Texas|Del Rio]]&amp;ndash;[[Ciudad Acuña]] and [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]]&amp;ndash;[[Piedras Negras, Coahuila|Piedras Negras]].
[[Image:Riogrande.jpg|thumb|300px|The Rio Grande flowing in [[Big Bend National Park]]]]
The US and Mexico share the waters of this river under a series of agreements administered by the joint US-Mexico Boundary and Water Commission.  The most notable of these were signed in 1906 and 1944. 

Use of that belonging to the US is regulated by the [[Rio Grande Compact]], an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico and Texas. The Rio Grande is over-appropriated, that is, there are more users for the water than there is water in the river. Because of both drought and overuse the section from El Paso downstream through [[Ojinaga]] was recently tagged &quot;The Forgotten River&quot; by those wishing to bring attention to the river's deteriorated condition. Ecologists fear that unless rainfall returns to normal levels during the next few years and strict water conservation measures are adopted by communities along the river, the Rio Grande may soon become extinct. 

The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; El Paso is 3762 [[foot (unit of length)|ft]] (1147 [[meter|m]]) above [[sea level]]. In New Mexico, the river flows through the [[Rio Grande Rift]] from one [[sediment]]-filled basin to another, cutting [[canyon]]s between the basins and supporting a fragile [[bosque]] ecosystem in its [[floodplain]]. [[Image:Rio Grande Creede.jpg|thumb|300px|The Upper Rio Grande near [[Creede, Colorado]]]] From El Paso eastward the river flows through [[desert]].  Only in the [[sub-tropical]] lower [[Rio Grande Valley]] is there extensive irrigated  agriculture.  The river ends in a small [[sand]]y [[river delta|delta]] at the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  During periods of extended dry weather, the river will actually cease flowing into the Gulf.

Millions of years ago, the Rio Grande ended at the bottom of the Rio Grande Rift in [[Lake Cabeza de Vaca]].  But about one [[mya (unit)|million years ago]] the [[stream capture|stream was &quot;captured&quot;]] and began to flow east.

The Rio Grande was designated as one of the [[American Heritage Rivers]] in [[1997]].

==Names and pronunciation==
''Río Grande'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for &quot;Big River&quot; and ''Río Grande del Norte'' means &quot;Great Northern River&quot; (literally &quot;Great River of the North&quot;). Rio Grande is pronounced either /ɹioʊ gɹænd/ or /ɹioʊ gɹændi/ (where &quot;Grande&quot; is pronounced like the English word &quot;grand&quot;) by English speakers. Because &quot;río&quot; means &quot;river&quot; in Spanish, the phrase &quot;Rio Grande River&quot; is redundant.

==Description==
The Rio Grande rises in the [[San Juan Mountains]] of the U.S. state of [[Colorado]], flows through the [[San Luis Valley]], then south into [[New Mexico]] through [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]] and [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], [[Texas]], on the [[United States–Mexico border|U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico border]]. A major tributary, the [[Río Conchos]], enters at [[Ojinaga, Chihuahua]], below El Paso, and supplies most of the water in the 1,254 mi (2,019 km) Texas border segment. Other known tributaries include the [[Pecos River|Pecos]] and the smaller [[Devils River (Texas)|Devils]], which join the Rio Grande on the site of [[Amistad Reservoir|Amistad Dam]]. Despite its name and length, the Rio Grande is not navigable at all by oceangoing ships, nor are there smaller craft using it as a route. In fact it is barely navigable at all.

The river has, since [[1845]], marked the boundary between Mexico and the [[United States]] from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and [[Ciudad Juárez|Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], to the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. As such, it was across this river that Texan slaves fled when seeking their freedom, aided by Mexico's liberal colonization policies and abolitionist stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://crm.cr.nps.gov/archive/21-4/21-4-13.pdf &quot;The UGRR on the Rio Grande&quot;]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major international border crossings along the river are Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; [[Presidio, Texas]] and [[Ojinaga, Chihuahua]]; [[Laredo, Texas]] and [[Nuevo Laredo|Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas]]; [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen-Hidalgo, Texas]], and [[Reynosa|Reynosa, Tamaulipas]]; and [[Brownsville, Texas]], and [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]].
