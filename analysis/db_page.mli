(** This class contains methods to read consecutive revisions belonging
    to a page from the database. *)

class page : 
  Online_db.db -> (* Online database containing the pages and revisions *)
  Online_revision.revision -> (* We need to read from the database
            colored revisions that immediately precede this revision. *)
  int -> (* number of revisions to fetch, used to limit the query to 
	    the database.  Note that this class can return more (as there 
	    is some slack in the query, see inside the class for details) 
	    or fewer revisions (in case e.g. the page has fewer than the
	    specified number of revisions), so that the caller must still
	    then check on reading that the desired number of revisions
	    is returned. *)
  object
    (* This method gets, every time, the previous revision of the page, 
       starting from the revision id that was given as input. 
       The method returns a revision option, returning either (Some revision) 
       or (None), the latter to indicate that no previous revision was 
       present in the database. *)
