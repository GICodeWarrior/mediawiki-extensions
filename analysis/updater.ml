(** This class updates the reputation, origin, and trust information.
    Various types of update are available:

    - Global update: chronologically processes all unprocessed revisions 
      and votes, bringing all up to date. 

    - Page update: chronologically processes all unprocessed revisions 
      and votes for a single page, bringing the page up to date. 

    - Immediate vote: processes a vote assuming that the revision 
      voted on has already been analyzed.

    We could also consider, in the future:

    - Immediate edit: processes an edit to a page, assuming that
      the revision that has been edited has already been analyzed.

		 If it succeeds, colors the page. 
		 
		 The page lock is not used for correctness: rather, it
		 is used to limit transaction parallelism, and to allow
		 revisions to be analyzed in parallel: otherwise, all
		 processes would be trying to analyze them in the same
		 order, and they would just queue one behind the next.
		 The use of these locks, along with the [tried]
		 hashtable, enforces bounded overtaking, allowing some
		 degree of out-of-order parallelism, while ensuring that
		 the revisions of the same page are tried in the correct
		 order.
		 
		 We set the timeout for waiting as follows. 
		 - If the page has already been tried, we need to wait on it, 
	           so we choose a long timeout. 
	           If we don't get the page by the long timeout, this means that
	           there is too much db lock contention (too many simultaneously
	           active coloring processes), and we terminate. 
	         - If the page has not been tried yet, we set a short timeout, 
	           and if we don't get the lock, we move on to the next 
		   revision. 

		 This algorithm ensures an "overtake by at most 1"
		 property: if there are many coloring processes active
		 simultaneously, and r_k, r_{k+1} are two revisions of a
		 page p, it is possible that a process is coloring r_k
		 while another is coloring a revision r' after r_k
		 belonging to a different page p', but this revision r'
		 cannot be past r_{k+1}.  *)
