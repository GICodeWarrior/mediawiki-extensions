/**
 * A really simple extension to allow for making certain namespaces
 * "private"--that is, to prevent users lacking necessary rights from
 * reading, editing, moving, etc., any page in that namespace. It
 * should cover transclusion, searching (though the titles will still
 * be visible), diffs, Special:Export, history paging, etc.
 *
 * NOTE: MediaWiki is designed to make content _open_, not to restrict
 * access to content. As such code such as this that prevents read
 * access is generally very fragile. While it has been tested under a
 * variety of set-ups, and most methods of circumvention have been
 * addressed, it should not be fully trusted as "secure". Be especially
 * careful when installing new extensions as they may open up a variety
 * of new ways to get around what this code aims to do.
 *
 * USAGE:
 * Add require_once("$IP/extensions/PrivateNamespaces/PrivateNamespaces.php");
 * to your LocalSetings.php.
 *
 * To restrict access to a namespace with the id '100' to a group with
 * the right "foobar" add:
 * 	$wgPrivateNamespaces[100] = 'foobar';
 *
