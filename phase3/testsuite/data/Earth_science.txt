'''Earth science''' is the the study of the [[Earth]] and its processes. This disipline includes [[geology]], [[geophysics]], [[meteorology]], [[physical geography]] (as opposed to [[human geography]]), [[mineralogy]], [[paleontology]] (also known as paleobiology), [[geodesy]] and other sciences.  [[Marine science]] and [[environmental science]] are highly interdisciplinary branches of earth sciences.
Arguably, earth science can be regarded as a branch of [[planetary science]].
