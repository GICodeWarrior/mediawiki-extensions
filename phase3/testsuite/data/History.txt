'''History''' is often used as a generic term for information about the past, e.g., as in "geologic history of the Earth".  When used as a field of study, history refers to human history, which is the recorded past of human societies.  

The term "history" comes from the Greek ''historia'', "an account of one's inquiries", and  shares that [[etymology]] with the English word "story".

Historians use many types of sources, including written or printed records, interviews ([[oral history]]), and [[archaeology]].    Different approaches may be more common in some periods than others, and the study of history has its fads and fashions (see [[historiography]], the history of history).  The events that occurred prior to human records are known as [[prehistory]].
