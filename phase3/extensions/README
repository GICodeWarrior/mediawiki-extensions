Some extensions (such as the hieroglyphic module WikiHiero) are
distributed separately. Drop them into this extensions directory
and enable as per the extension's directions.

If you are a developer, you want to fetch the extension tree in
another directory and make a symbolic link:

 mediawiki/extensions$ ln -s ../../extensions-trunk/FooBarExt
