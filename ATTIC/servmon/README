::Servmon:.

Servmon is an automated server monitoring tool used on the Wikimedia servers.
It's also meant to be usable elsewhere, but may need some tweaking.

Please send any changes you make back to me at <keturner@livejournal.com>.

To use servmon you will need:
    - Unix. It's tested on Solaris, RedHat Linux and GNU/Debian.
      Other systems may or may not work; if you have to make any changes
      to build it, please let me know. I am interested in supporting non-Unix
      systems but do not have access to any.
    - A C++ compiler.  GCC <2.95 will not work. GCC 2.95 may work.
      Tested with >= 3.3.
    - The Boost library (http://www.boost.org/). Debian users can install it
      using the packages libboost-dev libboost-thread-dev
      libboost-regex-dev 
    - SCons (http://www.scons.org/).

You will also need development headers for at least:
    libmysql (libmysql15-dev)
	libsnmp (libsnmp9-dev)

To build:
	copy buildconfig.sample to buildconfig and edit as needed;
	run 'scons'
