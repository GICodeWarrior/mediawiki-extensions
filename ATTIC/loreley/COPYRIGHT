Until SVN revision 17873 (2006-11-23), the core Loreley source code was ostensibly
in the public domain.  Due to copyright vagueries, it is now subject to the
following copyright:

	Copyright (c) 2005, 2006 River Tarnell <river@attenuate.org>.

	Permission is granted to anyone to use this software for any purpose,
	including commercial applications, and to alter it and redistribute it
	freely. This software is provided 'as-is', without any express or implied
	warranty.

Some included source code is copyrighted and released under a difference license;
the license information for these files can be found in their individual headers:

	src/include/radix.h
	src/include/acl.h
	src/libloreley/radix.cc
	src/loreley/daemon.c
	src/loreley/strlcpy.c
	src/loreley/strlcat.c
	src/lreadlog/acl.cc

In general, it's fine to import source code which is copyrighted, so long as
the copyright terms permit free (re)use, and do not require Loreley itself to 
be restricted; e.g., do not import GPL-licensed source code.  Don't require
external dependencies that are not under similar licences.  The Berkeley DB
code is acceptable, because it can be licenced for commercial use.
