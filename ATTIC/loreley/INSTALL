                         Loreley installation
                         ====================

Requirements:

1. zlib (http://www.zlib.net/)
2. Oracle Berkeley DB (http://www.oracle.com/database/berkeley-db.html)
3. libevent (http://monkey.org/~provos/libevent/)
4. Boost (http://www.boost.org/)
5. A reasonably good C++ compiler (gcc4 is fine, gcc3.4 is okay, 2.95
   is right out).

Boost only needs the header files, it does not have to be compiled.
After you extract the archive, use "--with-boost=/path/to/boost_1_33_1".

To prepare (only if building from SVN):

$ sh autogen.sh

To build:

$ ./configure [--with-zlib=<path>] [--with-bdb=<path>] [--with-libevelt=<path>] \
               [--with-boost=<path>] [--prefix=<path>]
$ make
$ make install

The file src/loreley/confgrammar.cc can be a problem for some compilers.
GCC 3.4 will use ~350MB RAM and take several minutes to compile it.  If
possible use GCC 4.1, which is much faster and uses less memory.  Intel
C/C++ 9.1 is also good.  This file also emits a long warning when compiled
which can be ignored.

GNU "make" is not required.  However, "make" must be in your path at the
time you run configure, otherwise use "MAKE=/path/to/make ./configure".

Other variables:

CC		C compiler
CXX		C++ compiler
CPPFLAGS	Additional flags for compilation
CFLAGS		Additional flags for compilation and linking
LDFLAGS		Additional flags for linking

An example configuration is provided as "loreley.conf.example".  Copy that to
<prefix>/etc/loreley.conf and edit as needed.
