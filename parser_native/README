This is the AbuseFilter native expression parser.  It improves the performance 
of the filter by using a C++ program to parse the expression.

parser_native has been tested on these platforms:

* Solaris 10 with GCC 3.4.3
* Solaris 10 with Sun Studio 12 (C++ patch 124864-04)
* Debian Linux with GCC 4.3.1

parser_filter requires Boost (www.boost.org) 1.35.0 or higher.  Earlier versions
will generate a parser which does not work.

To compile it, copy makefile.config.example to makefile.config, edit it, and
run 'make'.  (GNU make is required.)
