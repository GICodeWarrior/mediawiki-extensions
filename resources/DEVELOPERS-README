As of late 2010, this extension maintains its own minified versions of CSS and Javascript.

If you edit a CSS or JS file, make sure to run the 'generateMinifiedResources.php' script from the extension root before committing
your changes to the repository.

If ResourceLoader becomes a possibility later, of course that functionality will no longer be necessary and should be removed.
