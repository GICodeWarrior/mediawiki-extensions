== SMW skins for MediaWiki ==

This directory contains files and directories that provide additional
MediaWiki skins that are provided with Semantic MediaWiki. To use such
a skin, you need to copy the respective files and directories to the
skin directory of your MediaWiki installation first. If you platform
supports this, it is recommended to use symbolic links instead, so that
you do not require extra copies of all files.

Currently the only skin provided is "ontoskin", an experimental extension
of "monobook" that supports editors of semantic content. Note that this 
experimental skin is still under development and might not be usable yet.
