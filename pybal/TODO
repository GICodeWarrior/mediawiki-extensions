TODO for PyBal

* Resolve hostnames to IPs at startup, and then use IPs
  exclusively for monitoring / LVS state modification, so it's
  more robust when the DNS resolver is flaky
* Split off classes in pybal.py to a separate module, and make
  pybal.py an executable pybal script
* Daemon mode with logfiles instead of in screen
* IRC notification
* An ICMPReachability monitor that checks whether the realservers
  are actually reachable *on their service IPs* - requires
  Twisted Pair or python-eunuchs for creating non-routed raw
  IP packets
* (Partial) lvsmon-like configuration from textfiles retrieved
  from the realservers, e.g. for computing the weight of a realserver
