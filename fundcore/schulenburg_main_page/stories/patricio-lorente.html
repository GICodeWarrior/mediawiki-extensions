<p>Do you know <b>Patricio Lorente</b>?</p>
<p>From the outside, Patricio seems like a typical Argentinian &ndash; he loves soccer, good food, and spending time with friends. When Patricio began working for an international development agency in 1991 he became deeply aware of the disparity that existed between those that &quot;have and don't have.&quot;</p>
<p>Today Patricio and his friends from Wikimedia Argentina are researching ways to help underprivileged students and schools in Argentina with textbooks created with Wikipedia's free content.</p>
<p>With your donations we'll help Patricio and his friends to transform the reality of many underprivileged people in his homeland into something positive and hopeful.</p>
