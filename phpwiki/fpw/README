1. Introduction
===============

This is the PHP script which runs Wikipedia, the free collaborative
encyclopedia at 

           http://www.wikipedia.com

Among the software's features are:

  * Users can edit all articles on the web site running the script.
  * Articles are stored in a mysql database.
  * Articles can belong to different namespaces, thus allowing to
    distinguish between encyclopedia articles proper and technical,
    user and discussion articles surrounding the project.
  * Full text search on all articles.
  * Allows to upload images and other files.
  * Allows the users to keep a "watchlist" of articles whose changes
    they want to track.
  * Provides various statistics and lists:
         * number of accesses of a given article
         * most popular topics that are referred to but don't have articles yet
         * list of previously edited articles
         * list of articles that link to a given article
         * list of articles ("orphans") that no other article links to
         * list of logged in users


2. Installation
===============

You need apache, php and mysql. Make sure that those three work well
together before you continue to install the wikipedia script.

Create a directory in your apache htdocs directory to hold the
Wikipedia php scripts. In the sequel, we will use the directory
"wiki". Copy all *.php and *.phtml files there.

Create a mysql user and password and a database you want to use for
Wikipedia articles. Then run mysql as that user, and source the file
wikipedia.sql in order to create the tables needed.

Move the images wiki.png and startrek.png somewhere on your web server.

You then need to edit the file wikiLocalSettings.php. Add lines like
this:

$wikiThisDBserver = "127.0.0.1";  # the address of the computer running mysqld
$wikiSQLServer = "wikidb";        # the mysql database used for Wikipedia
$wikiThisDBuser = "wikiuser";     # the mysql user
$wikiThisDBpassword = "xxx";      # mysql password

# Preferred URL of the web server running Wikipedia
$wikiCurrentServer = "http://wikipedia.mydomain.org";

# How to access an article on your site. Change this if you use
# apache's rewrite module to produce nicer URLs on your site (as is
# done on wikipedia.com)
$wikiArticleSource = "$wikiCurrentServer/wiki/wiki.phtml?title=$1";    

# The URS's on your server for the two image files 
$wikiLogoFile = "/wiki.png" ;
$wikiStarTrekImage = "/startrek.png" ;

You can look through wikiSettings.php for other variables to change.

If everything is ok, you can access the URL wiki.phtml in your web
site's wiki directory and you should get the (still empty) main page.

If you want to test the performance of the code, you can install a
realistically sized (23 MB) but outdated database from the mysql
database dump

     http://wikipedia.sourceforge.net/fpw/newiki.sql.gz

Please do not use this database on a site visible to the public, to avoid
confusion.


3. Updating
===========

When updating to a new version of the PHP script, you may want to hold
on to your previous version of wikiLocalSettings.php.

If the new version needs any change in the database schema, the mysql
script updSchema.sql can be used. Before sourcing that file, uncomment
those lines that need to be updated for your database.


4. Mailing list
===============

The further development of the software is discussed on the wikitech-l
mailing list. See 

      http://ross.bomis.com/mailman/listinfo/wikitech-l

for information about how to sign up and for the mailing list
archives.
