1. Introduction
===============

This is the PHP script which runs Wikipedia, the free collaborative
encyclopedia at 

           http://www.wikipedia.com

Among the software's features are:

  * Users can edit all articles on the web site running the script.
  * Articles are stored in a MySQL database.
  * Articles can belong to different namespaces, thus allowing to
    distinguish between encyclopedia articles proper and technical,
    user and discussion articles surrounding the project.
  * Full text search on all articles.
  * Allows to upload images and other files.
  * Allows the users to keep a "watchlist" of articles whose changes
    they want to track.
  * Provides various statistics and lists:
         * number of accesses of a given article
         * most popular topics that are referred to but don't have articles yet
         * list of recently edited articles
         * list of articles that link to a given article
         * list of articles ("orphans") that no other article links to
         * list of contributions per user
         

2. First-time installation
==========================

You need Apache, PHP and MySQL. Make sure that those three work well
together before you continue to install the wikipedia script.

The following versions have been reported to work together:
  * MySQL 3.23.37, Apache 1.3.23, PHP 4.0.4pl1 on Linux 
    (these are the versions running on wikipedia.com)
  * MySQL 3.23.41, Apache 1.3.23, PHP 4.1.1 on Linux
  * MySQL 3.23.47-max, Apache 1.3.20, PHP 4.1.1 on Windows

Mysql 4.0.0 alpha causes problems and should be avoided for now.

Note that PHP can either use its own built-in MySQL libraries, or the
MySQL libraries from the MySQL distribution. If you choose the latter
option, and you upgrade MySQL later, then you also need to recompile PHP.

Create a directory in your Apache htdocs directory to hold the
Wikipedia PHP scripts. In the sequel, we will use the directory
"/wiki". Copy all *.php and *.phtml files there. Create a subdirectory
"/upload". Make sure that the web server process has permission to
write to that directory.

To your http.conf file, add the line
   AddType application/x-httpd-php .php .phtml
This is needed because the main wikipedia script has the extension .phtml.

Move the images wiki.png and startrek.png somewhere on your web server.

Create a new MySQL database to be used for Wikipedia (we are using "wikidb"
in the sequel). Then create a MySQL user and password (we use
"wikiuser" and "xxx" below) and grant that user read and write rights
for wikidb. Then run mysql as that user:
  $ mysql -u wikiuser
  mysql> use wikidb;
  mysql> source wikipedia.sql;
in order to create the tables needed.

The MySQL server needs to use the same timezone as PHP, or else you
will later get bogus edit conflicts. Do:
  $ mysql -u wikiuser -e "select now();"
If the output is different from your current local time, you should
start mysqld with the --timezone command line option, or set your TZ
environment variable.

In your php.ini file, you need to have the variable register_globals
set to On. Newer PHP versions set this variable to Off by default.
If you want, you can set error_reporting to E_ALL in order to get all
PHP warnings, which may be useful for debugging.

You then need to edit the file wikiLocalSettings.php. Add lines like
these:

$wikiThisDBserver = "127.0.0.1";  # the IP address of the computer running mysqld
$wikiSQLServer = "wikidb";        # the mysql database used for Wikipedia
$wikiThisDBuser = "wikiuser";     # the mysql user
$wikiThisDBpassword = "xxx";      # mysql password

# Preferred URL of the web server running Wikipedia
$wikiCurrentServer = "http://wikipedia.mydomain.org";

# Location of the main wiki.phtml script on that server:
$THESCRIPT = "/wiki/wiki.phtml";

# How to access an article on your site. Change this if you use
# Apache's rewrite module to produce nicer URLs on your site (as is
# done on wikipedia.com)
$wikiArticleSource = "$wikiCurrentServer$THESCRIPT?title=$1";    

# The URL's on your server for the two image files 
$wikiLogoFile = "/wiki.png" ;
$wikiStarTrekImage = "/startrek.png" ;

You can look through wikiSettings.php for other variables to change.
In particular, if you want to run a Wikipedia in a language different
from English, you need add a line of the form
$wikiLanguage = "de"; #for German

If everything is ok, you can access the URL wiki.phtml in your web
site's wiki directory and you should get the (still empty) main page.

If you want to test the performance of the code, you can install an
(outdated) Wikipedia database dump from

     http://wikipedia.sourceforge.net/wikidb.sql.gz  (25MB)

or a more recent database dump from 

     http://www.wikipedia.com/tarballs/ (80MB)

Please do not use these databases on a wiki web site editable by the
public, to avoid confusion.


3. Updating to a newer version
==============================

When updating to a new version of the PHP script, you may want to hold
on to your previous version of wikiLocalSettings.php.

If the new version needs any change in the database schema, the MySQL
script updSchema.sql can be used. Before sourcing that file, uncomment
those lines that apply to you.


4. Mailing list
===============

The further development of the software is discussed on the wikitech-l
mailing list. See 

      http://www.nupedia.com/mailman/listinfo/wikitech-l

for information on how to sign up and where to find the mailing list
archives.


5. Hacking hints
================

A general description of the structure and operation of the code would
be very desirable, but doesn't exist yet. So you have to read the
source. The file wiki.phtml is the entry point which is called by the
web server.

When debugging PHP code, the user_error() function is very useful for
examining variable values.

To review what changes have been checked into the cvs repository in the
last 2 days, issue the command
  $ cvs log -d ">-2days" | more
from the source directory.

If you want to check in your own changes to the code, you need an
account on sourceforge.net and permission from Magnus Manske.
Before checking in your own changes, you should do
  $ cvs -z3 update
in order to bring your version of the code up to the current state and
resolve possible conflicts resulting from other people editing the
same files you have been working on. Then do
  $ cvs -z3 diff | more
in order to review your changes one last time and catch typos. Then
check in with
  $ cvs -z3 commit
