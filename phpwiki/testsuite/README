This is a first pass at a unit test and timing suite
for the Wikipedia software. It is all in Java, using
"httpunit" (http://httpunit.sourceforge.net/). The
jars in the jars directory need to be in your classpath
for compiling and running (it may require others as
well depending on your JVM, but if you're a Java coder
you know about all that). Apache's "ant" tool is used
for building.

I'm personally using generic Sun JDK 1.4 for Linux.
