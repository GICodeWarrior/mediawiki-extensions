Broadly speaking, '''music''' is any artful or entertaining arrangement of [[sound|sounds]], deliberate or otherwise. The actual [[definition of music]] is hotly contested.

We can define "music" more formally as a series of organized sounds and silences temporal in nature, which those who know it can reproduce.

All music also has some varying degree of [[rhythm]] and [[melody]]. [[Harmony]] is often added.
