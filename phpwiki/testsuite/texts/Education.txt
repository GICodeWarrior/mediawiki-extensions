'''Education''' is a term which encompasses the teaching of specific [[skill]]s, and also something less tangible but more profound: the imparting of [[knowledge]], good [[judgement]] and [[wisdom]].

Education begins the minute a baby is born and is life-long. For some, the struggles and triumphs of daily life are far more instructive than formal schooling (Thus Mark Twain: &quot;I never let school interfere with my education.&quot;) [[Family]] members have an educational effect which is quite profound -- often more profound than they realize -- though family teaching techniques may be highly informal.

Formal education occurs when society makes a commitment to educate people, usually the young.  Formal education has the advantage of being fairly systematic and thorough; but critics have always noted that whoever sponsors formal education, be it a church, the state or some other group, that group will almost always seek to shape its impressionable scholars in that image.

In recent years, life-long education has become far more widespread, and many adults have given up their notion that only children belong in school. However - the recent years of technology developments with portable computing devices may change some of the classical places where we do learn - OR where we find knowledge. In some places the learning can happen in real time as we need the knowledge itself. This is the computer based / networked learning stucture, where people contribute to each other's education.
