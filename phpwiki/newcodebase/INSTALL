This software requires Apache, MySQL, and PHP.  Apache and
MySQL versions are reasonably sane, so it shouldn't make
much difference which you use.  But PHP seems to make major
changes to the language on a whim with each release, so it's
not unlikely that you'll have to make some changes depending
on which version you have.

The most recent test setup was Apache 1.3.26, MySQL 3.23.49,
and PHP 4.2.1.  The output-recoding feature requires that
PHP be compiled with libiconv.  If you don't need that
feature, just turn it off.  Wikipedia's live installation
also uses APC, but that's not required.

To install the software, either put all the scripts in the
same directory or else put the .phtml files in one directory
and the .php files in PHP's include path.

Use "buildtables.sql", "initializedb.sql", and
"buildindexes.sql" (in that order) to initialize the database.

Edit LocalSettings.php to reflect local installation paths
and such.
