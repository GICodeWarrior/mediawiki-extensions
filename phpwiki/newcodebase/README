This is a new codebase that attempts to reproduce (more or less
exactly, modulo some bugs and some things I don't like) the
functionality of Magnus Manske's PHP Wikipedia software.  I've
stolen a lot of Magnus and Brion's code, and nearly all of their
database structure and output design, changing only those things
I thought needed fixing (namepsaces are in a separate database
field, for example, and I made the stylesheets external).

This new codebase, however, should be much easier to test, debug,
enchance, and customize.  My primary motivation, in fact, is
wanting to have this software for my own site, and not being
happy with either the limited functionality of UseMod or the
incomprehensible code of the existing PHP stuff.

In its present state, it is minimally functional, and will do
only the basic Wiki view pages and edit pages, and user logins.
It has hooks for future internationalization, but no other
languages are currently ported.

You'll need to convert the database before you run it as well.
There's a running installation on piclab.com/newwiki, and I can
be talked into giving accounts there, though I think it should
be possible to get this running on SourceForge as well.
