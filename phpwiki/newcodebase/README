This is a new codebase for the Wikipedia project
(http://www.wikipedia.com), though it is intended to be
usable for other wiki sites without much headache.

The code as a whole is Copyright 2002 by Lee Daniel Crocker
and others, licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public
License, version 2 (see http://www.fsf.org/licenses/gpl.html).
Derivative works and later versions of the code will also be
considered free software licensed under the same terms.

Other developers include Magnus Manske, Jan Hidders,
Brion Vibber, Axel Boldt, and Geoffrey T. Dairiki.
Many thanks to the Wikipedia regulars for testing and
suggestions.

The code is currently maintained at Sourceforge under the
project "wikipedia".  You can view the code in CVS, report
bugs and make feature requests there:

The code is written in PHP.  It was tested mainly on version 4.06,
but it is known to run in later versions.  I requires MySQL 3.23
or later, and PHP-MySQL.  It is now running with PHP 4.2.2 and
MySQL 3.23.49 at http://www.wikipedia.com .
