Work in progress. :)

Batch-testing tools loading the parsing code into node.js, and going through a MediaWiki XML export dump to run round-trip tests over it. Currently not much will succeed as there's bad handling of newlines. ;)

Need npm modules:
* html5
* jquery
* jsdom
* diff
* libxmljs (requires native compilation)
* webworker
