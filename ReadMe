==1. Overview==
The video namespace facilitates creation and displaying of new video
description pages that contain embeddable flash videos. 

It introduces the [[Video:Name]] MediaWiki markup (and <video name="Name"/>)

Also allows functionality for Video Galleries (similar to <gallery>) and
showing Videos in category pages.

==2. Requirements==
The '''Video Namespace''' extension requires MediaWiki 1.16.0 or greater.

r88235 (or greater) is required for proper undeletion support. Without that
revision, videos cannot be undeleted properly; only the video page is
undeleted, the actual video will be gone forever without that patch.

==3. Installing Video Extension==
Installing the Video extension is very easy if you have shell (SSH) access to
your server.

You should run video.sql against the database with a command like
mysql -u DATABASE_USER -p DATABASE_NAME < video.sql
in your terminal window to generate the two necessary tables, oldvideo and video.
Alternatively, you can add the require_once() line below into the wiki's
LocalSettings.php and then run maintenance/update.php to create the two tables.

If you don't have shell access, you should copy the contents of video.sql and
paste them into phpMyAdmin's SQL prompt to create the tables.

Then add the following into your wiki's LocalSettings.php:

require_once("$IP/extensions/Video/Video.php");

==4. New Special Pages==
Video extension introduces two new special pages, Special:AddVideo and Special:NewVideos.

Special:AddVideo is used to add a video and Special:NewVideos displays a list
of newly added videos à la Special:NewFiles.

==5. New User Rights==
Video extension introduces one new user right, 'addvideo'.
Users with the addvideo right can upload videos through Special:AddVideo.
By default, all registered users are given this right.

The 'reupload' user right is required to upload new videos of pre-existing
videos.

In addition, everyone is able to view Special:NewVideos special page.

==6. Bug Reports and More==

==7. Credits==
The initial idea and coding was done by David Pean <david.pean@gmail.com>.

Łukasz 'TOR' Garczewski <tor@wikia-inc.com> rewrote Special:AddVideo.

Bartek Łapiński <bartek@wikia-inc.com> made a couple small bugfixes and
participated in the development of WikiaVideo extension, which was forked from
this extension.

Przemek Piotrowski <ppiotr@wikia-inc.com> wrote the YouTube extension, from
which a lot of code for various different video providers was extracted. Thanks
to him, we can embed media from Archive.org, Gametrailers.com, GoGreenTube.com
and WeGame.com.

Jack Phoenix <jack@countervandalism.net> performed code cleanup and wrote the
code for deleting videos and improved the undeletion code, ported a bunch of
providers from the YouTube extension and tweaked internationalization messages.

William Lee <wlee@wikia-inc.com> wrote some code for the WikiaVideo extension,
which was used to build providers/HuluVideo.php.
