# Mapping services configuration

	# Commenting or removing a mapping service will cause Semantic Maps to completely ignore it, and so improve performance.

# General

	# Boolean. Indicates if spatial extensions should be used for coordinate storage.
	# Spatial extensions significantly speed up querying, but are not present by default on postgres databases.

# Queries

	# Boolean. The default value for the forceshow parameter. Will force a map to be shown even when there are no query results
	# when set to true. This value will only be used when the user does not provide one.
