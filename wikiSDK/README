== Usage ==
=== Use on Windows ===
Requirements:
* Python (The latest version can be installed from http://python.org/download/)
* cygwin (SDK Scripts are written in Bash; Use the setup.exe script downloaded from http://cygwin.com/)
* Subversion (TortoiseSVN is helpfull for a UI form, but you will need the cygwin package for the bash scripts)
* PHP Binaries (Recomended package is the PHP zip package from http://www.php.net/downloads.php#v5)

Setup:
[1] Checkout the SDK from Subversion.
  svn checkout http://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/mediawiki/trunk/wikiSDK/ wikiSDK/
[2] cd into your wikiSDK directory using the Cygwin terminal.
[3] Run `./config` and enter in the paths and data needed. Remember to use \ on windows instead of / or things will break.
[4] Run `./server config` to create a new webserver configuration file.
[5] When you need to use the webserver to view things, just type `./server run` to start it up. ctrl+c or close the window to shutdown.
