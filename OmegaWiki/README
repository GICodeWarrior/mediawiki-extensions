WiktionaryZ is a universal dictionary and thesaurus built using Wikidata.

This directory contains:
* WiktionaryZ.php and related files - preliminary WiktionaryZ code (much functionality will go back into
MediaWiki). This code is not ready for use yet - more info/code to follow.
* WiktionaryZ.pm - a generic importer library for WiktionaryZ written in Perl that includes specific support for the GEMET and UMLS
thesauri.
