It is easy to forget to change the language to the correct one, so setting it now is highly recommended.

While you are there, you can also request the software to display translations in other languages you know.

At {{SITENAME}} there are people from all around the world working on different languages and projects.

The number behind the language code describes how well you know the language.
The alternatives are:

* 2 - basic knowledge
* 3 - good knowledge
* 4 - native speaker level
* 5 - you use the language professionally, for example you are a professional translator.

If you are a native speaker of a language, leave the skill level out, and only use the language code.
Example: if you speak Tamil natively, English well, and little Swahili, you would write:
<tt><nowiki>{{#babel:ta|en-3|sw-1}}</nowiki></tt>

A list of all message groups with the [[[Special:LanguageStats|current translation status for a language]] is also available.

If you feel that you need to understand more before you start translating, you can read the [[FAQ|Frequently asked questions]].
Unfortanely documentation can be out of date sometimes.
If there is something that you think you should be able to do, but cannot find out how, do not hesitate to ask it at the [[Support|support page]].

You can also contact fellow translators of the same language at [[Portal:$1|your language portal]].
The portal links to your current [[Special:Preferences|language preference]].
Please change it if needed.',
