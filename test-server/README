These are the configuration files and the layout currently in use at

The installation of CruiseControl and phpUnderControl follows the
directions here:
http://phpundercontrol.org/documentation/installation.html

After that, the projects/connectfour sample directory is erased and
the contents of the cc-home directory (e.g.  config.xml,
cruisecontrol.sh, etc) should be copied to your cruisecontrol installation.

You'll also want to install the Saxon-B XSLT parser:

    aptitude install libsaxonb-java

Add the cruisecontrol user:

    useradd ci

and put cruisecontrol-init.d in /etc/init.d/cruisecontrol:

    cp cruisecontrol-init.d /etc/init.d/cruisecontrol

Make sure CCDIR in the init.d script points to your cruisecontrol
installation.

make it executable

    chmod +x /etc/init.d/cruisecontrol

and make the symlinks:

    update-rc.d cruisecontrol defaults

Finally, start cruisecontrol:

    /etc/init.d/cruisecontrol start
