These are the configuration files and the layout currently in use at
http://ci.tesla.usability.wikimedia.org/

The installation of CruiseControl and phpUnderControl follows the
directions here:
http://phpundercontrol.org/documentation/installation.html

After that, the projects/connectfour sample directory is erased and
the config.xml, cruisecontrol.sh, and projects/mw directories from
this configuration are put into place.

Finally, add the cruisecontrol user:

    useradd ci

and put cruisecontrol-init.d in /etc/init.d/cruisecontrol:

    cp cruisecontrol-init.d /etc/init.d/cruisecontrol

make it executable

    chmod +x /etc/init.d/cruisecontrol

and make the symlinks:

    update-rc.d cruisecontrol defaults

Finally, start cruisecontrol:

    /etc/init.d/cruisecontrol start
