These are the configuration files and the layout currently in use at

The installation of CruiseControl and phpUnderControl follows the
directions here:
http://phpundercontrol.org/documentation/installation.html

After that, the projects/connectfour sample directory is erased and
the config.xml, cruisecontrol.sh, and projects/mw directories from
this configuration are put into place.
