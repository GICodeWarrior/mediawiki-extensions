===Load-balancing clusters===
[[Load balancing (computing)|Load-balancing]] clusters operate by having all workload come through one or more load-balancing front ends, which then distribute it to a collection of back end servers.  Although they are primarily implemented for improved performance, they commonly include high-availability features as well.  Such a cluster of computers is sometimes referred to as a [[server farm]].  There are many commercial load balancers available including  Platform LSF HPC, [[Sun Grid Engine]], [[Moab Cluster Suite]] and [[Maui Cluster Scheduler]].  The [[Linux Virtual Server]] project provides one commonly used free software package for the Linux OS. 

===High-performance (HPC) clusters===
High-performance clusters are implemented primarily to provide increased performance by splitting a computational task across many different [[Node (networking)|nodes]] in the cluster, and are most commonly used in scientific computing. One of the most popular HPC implementations is a cluster with nodes running [[Linux]] as the [[Operating system|OS]] and free software to implement the parallelism. This configuration is often referred to as a [[Beowulf (computing)|Beowulf]] cluster. Such clusters commonly run custom programs which have been designed to exploit the parallelism available on HPC clusters. Many such programs use libraries such as [[Message Passing Interface|MPI]] which are specially designed for writing scientific applications for HPC computers.
