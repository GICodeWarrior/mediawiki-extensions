Syntax:   \open <desc>
Alias:    \o
See also: \close

Opens a connection to the database specified by <desc>.  <desc> is a connection
specifier in the form <scheme>:<user>/<password>@<host>/<database>  (except
Oracle and SQLite, see below).  Some or all of the parts may be optional
depending on the connection type. 

If the connection is established successfully, the current active connection
is set to the new connection (see \switch).

Supported connection schemes:

	oracle
	mysql
	postgres
	maxdb
	odbc
        sqlite

Oracle: The TNS connection should be given as the host.  The database part is
not used.

SQLite: <desc> should be the path to the SQLite database.  It will be created
if it doesn't already exist.
