                             Skirmish
                             ========

Skirmish is a command-line SQL client with support for several DBMSs:

	* MySQL
	* PostgreSQL
	* Oracle
	* MaxDB
	* SQLite
	* Any other ODBC-compliant database

The client connects to the database and executes SQL command in a similar
manner to the database's native client.  Multiple connections can be opened
and used from within a single client instance.

For more information, see the manual page skirmish(1).
