Quick hack/ Test suite to check Mediawiki, sees which changes have been made to
mediawiki code, or to the database. Written by Kim Bruning

Currently handles 1 changeset only, this changeset is stored at the
remote location specified in the settings file.

==create_and_ul.sh==
<Depreciated gwicke 08/2008: only pull supported>

Creates a new changeset for the specified revision
will be run from the installer (so you never need to use this!)


==dl_and_check.sh [--detail|-d] [exclude]==
Checks changeset against current mediawiki and database for your revision
Will report any differences.

If the detail flag is set, will give more detail on mediawiki code comparison
	to wit: 
		diff -q (show only whether files differ) is turned off,
		diff -N (assume missing files are empty) is turned on.

Files and directories matching the optional exclude pattern will be ignored.
