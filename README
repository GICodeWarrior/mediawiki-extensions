This extension lets you customize the messages seen in the user login process based on passing a "campaign" variable
in to the Special:UserLogin page. 

So, if you append "&campaign={campaign}" to the user login process, any message created in includes/templates/Userlogin.php can be
overridden with MediaWiki:customusertemplate-{campaign}-{message}.

ex: If you wanted to change the text seen at the end of the signup page (a message called 'signupend') for users signing up from
the "foo" campaign, you would edit MediaWiki:customusertemplate-foo-signupend page, and this would be substituted
