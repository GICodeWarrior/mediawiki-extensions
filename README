The News extension provides a custom tag, <news>, that allows the inclusion of
an excerpt from the Special:Recentchanges page to be shown on any wiki page.
It supports several types of filtering as well as full custom formating of
entries, using template syntax.

<http://mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:News>

The News extension was originally written by Daniel Kinzler in 2007
and is released under the GNU General Public Licence (GPL).

Note that the functionality of this extension overlaps with the DynamicPageList
and DynamicPageList2 extensions - however, this extension has a different focus.

== INSTALLING ==

Copy the News directory into the extensions folder of your 
MediaWiki installation. Then add the following line to your
LocalSettings.php file (near the end):

  require_once( "$IP/extensions/News/News.php" );

== USAGE ==

To get the last 10 changes to your wiki on any wiki page, use the
following:

	<news/>

You can provide options to controll the listing (for example, 20
entries and no minor edits):

	<news limit="20" nominor/>

To define your own format for the generated list, you can provide a
pattern that will be used for each entry:

	<news limit="20" nominor>
	* [[{{{pagename}}}]] ([[User:{{{user}}}]], {{{timeanddate}}})
	</news>

For a full list of options and template parameters, see below.

=== OPTIONS ===
The following options (tag attributes) can be used to controll the output of the
<news> tags:

* unique        show only the most recent change to each page

* limit         the maximum number of entries to show

* categories    limit results to the given categories. Multiple categories can
                be given separated by "|"; Intersections of categories are not
                supported. Recursion into subcategories is not supported.

* namespaces    limit results to the given namespaces. Multiple namespaces can
                be given separated by "|"; you can use "0", "-" or "main" to
                refer to the default namespace.

* notalk        ignore all "talk" namespaces. Not used if the namespaces option
                is given.

* nominor       hide minor edits ("true" or "false", default is "false"). If
                given, the edit shown may not refer to the current revision. 

* nobot         hide bot edits ("true" or "false", default is "false"). If
                given, the edit shown may not refer to the current revision. 

* noanon        hide anonymous edits ("true" or "false", default is "false"). If
                given, the edit shown may not refer to the current revision. 

* onlypatrolled show only patrolled edits ("true" or "false", default is
                "false"). If given, the edit shown may not refer to the current
                revision. 

* onlynew       show only page creations ("true" or "false", default is
                "false"). If given, the edit shown may not refer to the current
                revision. 

=== PARAMETERS ===
When giving a template text between the <news> tags, the following
template-parameters are available (use them as {{{xxx}}}):

* rawtime      raw timestamp - can be formated using the parser function "time",
               e.g. {{#time:j. M.|{{{rawtime}}}}} 

* date         date of the edit, formated per user preference

* time         time of the edit, formated per user preference

* timeanddate  time and date of the edit, formated per user preference

* namespace    numeric namespace id, can be used with {{ns:{{{namespace}}}}}

* title        canonical title (without namespace prefix)

* pagename     full title, with namespace prefix

* type         numerical change type (0 = edit, 1 = new, 2 = move, 3 = log,
               4 = move-over)

* minor        "true" for minor changes, blank otherwise

* user         user name who made the entry

* comment      edit summary (escaped wikitext, safe to use)

* new_rev      revision id associated with this entry (or zero)

* old_rev      revision id associated with the entry before this one (or zero)

* diff         full diff link for the edit (or blank)

* permalink    full url to the revision created by the edit (may not be the
               current revision)

* bot          "true" for bot edits, blank otherwise

* new          "true" for newly created pages, blank otherwise

* patrolled    "true" if the edit was patrolled, blank otherwise

* old_len      page length before the edit

* new_len      page length after the edit
