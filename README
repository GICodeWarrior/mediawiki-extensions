== Requirements ==

* MediaWiki 1.17 or higher.
* A MySQL database backend.

== Installation ==

NOTICE: Up-to-date instalation instructions can be fount at the extension
page in mediawiki.org (link above).

 1. Download the extension and install it as `./extensions/Wikilog` ,
    relative to your MediaWiki installation directory.  You may checkout
    the latest version from the version control repository in this directory,
    or uncompress one of the ''zip'' or ''tgz'' archives provided and
    rename/symlink the directory created.

        NOTE: The directory name must either have that name, or
        `$wgWikilogStylePath` must be set to the proper path in order for
        the extension to reference stylesheets and images from the extension
        directory.

 2. Backup your database and local configuration, it is always a good idea.

 3. Configure the extension in your LocalSettings.php file by adding the
    following lines (replace `100`, with the first even-numbered namespace
    greater than or equal to 100 available in your wiki):

        require_once( 'extensions/Wikilog/Wikilog.php' );
        Wikilog::setupNamespace( 100, 'Blog', 'Blog_talk' );

 4. Run the `./maintenance/update.php` script in order to create or update
    the tables used by the extension.

        NOTE: This script needs to be executed every time the extension
        (or MediaWiki) is upgraded.

== General notes ==

Check the file RELEASE-NOTES for important notes and upgrade procedures for
the current version of Wikilog.
