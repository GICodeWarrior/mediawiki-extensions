== About ==

''Regex Fun'' is a MediaWiki extension by Daniel Werner which adds parser functions for performing regular expression
searches and replacements.
The '#regex' parser function is inspired by RegexParserFunctions from Jim R. Wilson and mostly compatible with it.
RegexParserFunctions has some design flaws and missing functionality that should be filled by this extension.

''Regex Fun'' defines the following parser functions within your wiki:

 - #regex:        Search or replace with help of php preg regular expression. Returns first match in search mode.
                  Use of the 'e' modifier behind the expression will be filtered and eliminated from the pattern!
 - #regexsearch:  Same as 'regex' with the difference that in replacement mode if no match could be found, an empty
                  string '' will be returned instead of the unaltered original.
 - #regexall:     Searches the whole string for as many matches as possible and returns them separated by a separator.
 - #regex_var:    Allows to access references of the last used 'regex' or 'regexsearch' function.
 - #regexquote:   Runs php function 'preg_quote' on a string to use user-input savelly in regex functions. In case the
                  first character is a character with special meaning in MW, it will be replaced with its hexadecimal
                  notation e.g. '\x23' instead of '#'. This will prevent from things going terribly wrong when using
                  user input within a regular expression.
