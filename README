1. INTRODUCTION
This extension implements links to redirects that expand to the redirect's target when the mouse is moved over them.

2. WHERE TO GET REDIRCITE
The current version of redircite can be downloaded from the MediaWiki SVN repository at http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/trunk/extensions/redircite
Simply click the redircite.php file, then click download. The latest version of this README can be downloaded in a similar way.

3. INSTALLATION
Download redircite.php (see section 2), create a directory named "redircite" (without quotes) in /path/to/your/wiki/extensions, then move redircite.php to the /path/to/your/wiki/extensions/redircite/ directory.

Open LocalSettings.php and add the following line just before the line with ?> on it:

require_once("$IP/extensions/redircite/redircite.php");

4. EXAMPLES
Say you have a page called "S1E01" which is a redirect to "Midnight on the Firing Line". If you type

<redircite>S1E01</redircite>

it will show as

S1E01

and if you move the mouse over it, it will expand to

Midnight on the Firing Line

Of course the text is also linked to the Midnight on the Firing Line article.
