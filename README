The Invitations extension allows certain software features to 
be enabled only by an invitation, similar to the way in which
the use of Google's Gmail was propagated.

INSTALL:
You may install this extension by running the included SQL file
against your database, and then by adding:
require_once('/path/to/Invitations.php'); to your LocalSettings.php file.

In order to use this to restrict a feature, use:

Invitations::hasInvite( 'feature-name', $user_object )

which will return a boolean value.

You will need to register your feature with the Invitations extension.
For that, I recommend a line similar to the following:

$wgInvitationTypes['centralauth'] = array( reserve => 5, limitedinvites => true, invitedelay => 24 * 3600 * 4 );
