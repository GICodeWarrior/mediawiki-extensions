== About ==

Data Transfer is an extension to MediaWiki that both exports XML
based on the current contents of pages in a wiki, and imports pages
in both XML format (using the same structure as the XML export) and
CSV format.  Both the XML and CSV formats use template calls, and
the fields within them, to define the data structure. Any text that
is not within a template calls gets placed into one or more "free
text" fields.

For more information on Data Transfer, see the extension
homepage at

Notes on installing Data Transfer can be found in the file INSTALL.
