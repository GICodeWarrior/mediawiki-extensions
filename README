External Editor Helper application (EE)

Purpose: Allows the use of arbitrary external applications for editing
or viewing resources on the web, e.g. in a wiki.

Example: You want to edit a picture in a wiki. If the wiki supports the
use of application/external-editor, you should find an editing link next
to the image. After you click that link, the wiki sends a resource
description file to the web browser which has the MIME type
application/external-editor. The web browser knows that this MIME type
is associated with the helper application ee.pl, which downloads the image,
starts the image editing application, and uploads the image back to the
server upon save.
 
Usage: Associate the MIME type application/external-editor in your web
browser with ee.pl. Configure the editors and viewing programs by
editing the file ~/.ee-helper/ee.ini (in your home directory); an
example should be part of the archive containing this program. To
save files back to the server, you also have to add authentication
information to the configuration file.
