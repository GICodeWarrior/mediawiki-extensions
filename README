== About ==

Maps is a MediaWiki extension that provides the ability to display coordinate data 
on maps and allows users to geocode addresses.

Due to it's unique structure, it allows you to use multiple mapping services to 
display your coordinates. These include Google Maps, Yahoo! Maps, OpenLayers, and 
also allow you to display maps with Google Earth, OpenStreetMaps, Bing maps and others.
Modifying the mapping service of a map is as easy as changing a single parameter!

Notes on installing Maps are found in the file INSTALL.
