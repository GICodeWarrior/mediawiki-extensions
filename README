This extension adds better MathML rendering of formulae in <math>
tags. It also recognizes some additional LaTeX commands.

See the manual (in the file manual.tex) and
http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Blahtex for more details.


Brief installation instructions:

1. compile blahtex
2. add 
       require_once( 'extensions/Blahtex/Blahtex.php' );
   to LocalSettings.php
3. enable XHTML output
4. (optionally) empty the cache


In more detail:

1. The Blahtex directory should be in the extensions subdirectory of
   the MediaWiki tree. To compile blahtex, go in the Blahtex/source
   directory and run either "make linux" or "make mac". 

2. Edit LocalSettings.php (in the root of the MediaWiki tree) and add
   the line

      require_once( 'extensions/Blahtex/Blahtex.php' );

   at the bottom of the file, but above the line containing "?>" .

   The extension has two configuration variables:
      $wgBlahtex        :  location of the blahtex executable
      $wgBlahtexOptions :  command-line options for blahtex

3. MathML can be only be contained in XHTML document, so you must
   change MediaWiki to emit XHTML. There are two possibilities:

   Either, add the following to LocalSettings.php :

      $wgMimeType = "application/xhtml+xml";
      $wgDocType  = "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1 plus MathML 2.0//EN\;
      $wgDTD      = "http://www.w3.org/Math/DTD/mathml2/xhtml-math11-f.dtd";

   This makes MediaWiki emit XHTML. The disadvantage is that some
   browsers do not understand XHTML and hence can not view the wiki.

   The alternative is to patch MediaWiki to only emit XHTML if the
   user select MathML and the browser accepts XHTML. This is achieved
   with the command 

       patch -p0 < extensions/Blahtex/mediawiki-patch.txt

4. Now, blahtex will be run on all <math> formulae that are added to
   the wiki. To clear the cache, so that blahtex is also run on the
   old formulae, give the SQL command 

       truncate math;
