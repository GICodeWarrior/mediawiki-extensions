== Introduction ==

METIS is a project of the German collecting society (collecive rights manager)
"VG Wort". Its purpose is to remunerate authors for the so called "Zweitnutzung",
the printing and copying of texts which is allowed by the German copyright law
for private use.

This extension adds the "counting pixel" that's used by METIS to count how
often an article has been read.

== Installation ==
1) Create the 'metis' table in your database using the metis.sql script in this
   directory

2) Load METIS pixels into your database, e.g. by using
	cat metispixels.txt | php METIS_load.php
   You can repeat this step later to add more pixels.

3) Add the following to your LocalSettings.php:

   include( "extensions/METIS/METIS.php" );

== Configuration ==
There are no config options at the moment

== Importing Pixels ==
See step 2) above.
