# Looking for UsabilityInitiative extensions? They've been moved to their own
# folders in /trunk/extensions/. Most of them have been ported to use
# ResourceLoader. This process has left some of these extensions incompatible
# with MediaWiki prior to 1.17. For 1.16 compatible versions (which are no
# longer under active development but can be used to fixing bugs on existing
# deployments) please see the branches/usability-initiative-1_16/ (which has
# the latest patches) or the branches/REL1_16/extensions/UsabilityInitiative
# branches.

# Dependent on 1.17
# * ClickTracking
# * PrefSwitch
# * Vector
# * WikiEditor

# Not dependent on 1.17
