== About ==

'Simple Farm' is a simple MediaWiki farm extension by Daniel Werner. It
automatically forwards to the wiki that should be accessed by either a
virtual script path (using a tiny bit of mod-rewrite) or by using sub-domains.
It is also possible to have members of the same farm using either of these
methods, not all members have to use the same.
Furthermore, 'Simple Farm' comes with a maintenance script which allows to
maintain several farm members at the same time, e.g. doing database updates
for all or certain farm members by executing just one command.
