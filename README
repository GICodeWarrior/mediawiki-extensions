This project contains a separate branch for each Mediawiki extension hosted in
the official subversion repository.  Full history (from trunk) is included.

This repo is useful as a remote for hacking on Mediawiki extensions.

If the repo looks out of date by more than a couple days, feel free to ping me
to update it or fix my update script. :-)
