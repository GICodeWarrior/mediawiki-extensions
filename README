1. INTRODUCTION
This extension implements links to redirects that expand to the redirect's target when the mouse is moved over them.

2. WHERE TO GET REDIRCITE
You can download a tarball at http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:ExtensionDistributor/Redircite .

3. INSTALLATION
Download the tarball (see section 2) and extract it in /path/to/your/wiki/extensions .

Open LocalSettings.php and add the following line just before the end:

require_once("$IP/extensions/redircite/redircite.php");

4. EXAMPLES
Say you have a page called "S1E01" which is a redirect to "Midnight on the Firing Line". If you type

<redircite>S1E01</redircite>

it will show as

S1E01

and if you move the mouse over it, it will expand to

Midnight on the Firing Line

Of course the text is also linked to the Midnight on the Firing Line article.
