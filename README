1. INTRODUCTION
This extension adds a special page which allows for searching in a more advanced way than Special:Search does. You can use complex AND/OR expressions, search for pages that don't match an expression, and search for pages that are or aren't in certain categories.

2. WHERE TO GET ADVANCEDSEARCH
You can download a tarball at http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:ExtensionDistributor/AdvancedSearch . If that link doesn't work yet, go to http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/trunk/extensions/AdvancedSearch and download all files in that directory. To download a file, simply click on it, then click the (download) link on top.

3. INSTALLATION
If you downloaded the tarball, extract it in the /path/to/your/wiki/extensions directory. If you downloaded the individual files, create the /path/to/your/wiki/extensions/AdvancedSearch directory and put the files you downloaded in there.

Open LocalSettings.php and add the following line at the end:

require_once("$IP/extensions/AdvancedSearch/AdvancedSearch.setup.php");

Finally, execute the following commands on the command line:

cd /path/to/your/wiki/maintenance
php update.php

3A. BUILDING THE INDEX
For the category search feature to work properly, the category index must be built. The index will gradually build itself as pages are edited, but if you want the category search to work right from the start, you have to build the index manually. You only need to do this once, as the index will keep itself up to date. To build the index, execute the following commands on the command line:

cd /path/to/your/wiki/extensions/AdvancedSearch
php populateCategorySearch.php

Building the index may take a long time on large wikis, and the wiki may slow down significantly while the index is being built. If this is the case, abort the script by pressing Ctrl+C and run "php populateCategorySearch.php --help" (without the quotes) to read about throttling options that can help you to build the index at a slower pace and keep the wiki usable.

4. USING SPECIAL:ADVANCEDSEARCH
To use the AdvancedSearch, go to the Special:AdvancedSearch special page. In the "Search in page content" text boxes, you can enter a list of words that should (or shouldn't) occur in the page content and/or title. The search is case-insensitive and you can use * as a wildcard, i.e. 'check*' will match both 'checkbox' and 'checkmate'. You can combine words with the AND and OR operators: searching for 'foo AND bar' will only list pages that include both words, whereas 'foo OR bar' will list pages that include either word. 'foo bar' is synonymous to 'foo AND bar'; if you want to search for 'foo bar' as a word, you have to quote it, i.e. '"foo bar"'. You can make more complex expressions by using parentheses, as in 'foo AND ( bar OR baz )'. Note that ( and ) should be separate words, so something like 'foo AND (bar OR baz)' won't do what you expect. If you use multiple operators without using parentheses, AND will take precendence over OR, so 'foo AND bar OR baz' is equivalent to '( foo AND bar ) OR baz'. Words shorter than four letters and some common words (so-called stop words) can't be searched for; if you try, an error message will be shown. A list of stop words can be found at http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/fulltext-stopwords.html .

The "Search in categories" text boxes work the same way as their title/content counterparts, except that 'foo bar' isn't interpreted as 'foo AND bar', so you don't need to quote category names with spaces in them.

In the "Namespaces" section, you can specify the namespaces to search in. By default, only the main namespace is searched; you can change the default in your preferences.

If you've configured it (see section 5A), the "Common categories" section will appear, containing the checkboxes and dropdown you configured. The checkboxes you check and the category you choose in the dropdown are added to the "List articles in these categories" field: if you enter "foo" in the text box, check the "bar" and "baz" checkboxes and select "foobar" in the dropdown, the complete search query will be 'foo AND ( bar OR baz ) AND foobar'.

If you check the permanent link checkbox, a permanent link of the form Special:AdvancedSearch/123 will be generated. Clicking this link will fill out the form exactly like you did and run the search again. This is useful when referring to searches, e.g. on talk pages.

5. CUSTOMIZING SPECIAL:ADVANCEDSEARCH
You can customize the search form by adding the common categories box, or by changing the text that appears on the form.

5A. COMMON CATEGORIES (CHECKBOXES)
You can add the common categories checkboxes by adding the following line to LocalSettings.php:

$wgAdvancedSearchSpeedCats = array('Living people' => 'Alive', 'Deceased people' => 'Dead');

This will add two checkboxes, one labeled "Alive" corresponding to [[Category:Living people]] and one labeled "Dead" corresponding to [[Category:Deceased people]]. Checking e.g. only the "Alive" checkbox will only list pages in [[Category:Living people]], checking both checkboxes will list pages in either category.

5B. COMMON CATEGORIES (DROPDOWN)
Additionally, you can add a dropdown to the common categories box. This will allow you to select one category, and will only list pages in that category. To add a dropdown, add the following to LocalSettings.php:

$wgAdvancedSearchSpeedCatsDropDown = array('2000', '2001', '2002', '2000s' => '2000 OR 2001 OR 2002');

This will create a dropdown with the choices 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2000s (in that order). Selecting '2000s' will list pages in either of the 2000, 2001 and 2002 categories.

5C. CHANGING INTERFACE MESSAGES
Interface messages are the texts displayed in the search form. You can change them by editing the corresponding MediaWiki: pages (i.e. to edit e.g. the advancedsearch-toptext message, edit [[MediaWiki:Advancedsearch-toptext]]). Note that customizing a message means that foreign users will no longer see the translation for the original message.

The messages most suitable for customization are listed below. For a full list of messages used by AdvancedSearch, see extensions/AdvancedSearch/AdvancedSearch.i18n.php .
