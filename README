1. INTRODUCTION
This extension allows for changing the author of a revision, e.g. an edit made by Alice can be changed to look like it was made by Bob instead. Of course, only privileged users can do this, and all changes are logged.

2. WHERE TO GET CHANGEAUTHOR
The current version of ChangeAuthor can be downloaded from the MediaWiki SVN repository at http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/trunk/extensions/ChangeAuthor You need to download three files: ChangeAuthor.body.php, ChangeAuthor.setup.php and ChangeAuthor.i18n.php To download a file, simply click on it and click the "Download" link.

3. INSTALLATION
Download the three files mentioned in section 2, create a directory named "ChangeAuthor" (without quotes) in /path/to/your/wiki/extensions , then move the three .php files to the /path/to/your/wiki/extensions/ChangeAuthor/ directory you just created. Open LocalSettings.php and add the following line at the end:

require_once("$IP/extensions/ChangeAuthor/ChangeAuthor.setup.php");

You should now see the ChangeAuthor extension listed on the Special:Version special page.

4. SETTING UP PERMISSIONS
You will probably not want to allow every user to be able to use this extension. To control who can and who can't use ChangeAuthor, two approaches can be used:

4A. USING EXISTING GROUPS
Add any of the following lines to LocalSettings.php to allow existing groups of users to use ChangeAuthor:

$wgGroupPermissions['*']['changeauthor'] = true; // Allow *everyone*, including anonymous users, to use ChangeAuthor. This is asking for vandalism
$wgGroupPermissions['user']['changeauthor'] = true; // Only logged-in users can use ChangeAuthor. Probably not very wise either
$wgGroupPermissions['autoconfirmed']['changeauthor'] = true; // Only users older than $wgAutoConfirmAge can use ChangeAuthor
$wgGroupPermissions['sysop']['changeauthor'] = true; // Only sysops can use ChangeAuthor. This is the recommended setup
$wgGroupPermissions['bureaucrat']['changeauthor'] = true; // Only bureaucrats can use ChangeAuthor

If you have created any custom groups in LocalSettings.php, you can allow these groups to use ChangeAuthor by adding

$wgGroupPermissions['groupname']['changeauthor'] = true;

to LocalSettings.php (replace 'groupname' with the name of your custom group).
NOTE: If a user is in multiple groups, they will be able to use ChangeAuthor even if that's allowed for only one of those groups. E.g.: if group A can't use ChangeAuthor but group B can, a user in both group A and B will be allowed to use ChangeAuthor. 

4B. CREATING A NEW GROUP
You can also create a separate group for users who can use ChangeAuthor. To do this, add the following line to LocalSettings.php:

$wgGroupPermissions['changeauthor']['changeauthor'] = true;

This creates a new group named 'changeauthor'. Only users in that group can use ChangeAuthor. You can add users to the changeauthor group using the Special:Userrights special page.

5. USING SPECIAL:CHANGEAUTHOR
You can change a revision's author using the Special:ChangeAuthor special page. First, enter the name of a page in the input box and click the "Go" button. You will now see a list of the last 50 revisions of the target page. Note that all usernames are in textboxes. To change the author of a revision, simply change the username in the associated textbox. Add a comment in the comment textbox (optional), click the "Change author(s)" button and you're done. If the revision whose author you want to change isn't among the 50 latest, you need to access it by its revision ID. You can find out a revision's ID by looking it up in the page history and click the link stating the date and time the revision was made. In your address bar, you will now see a URL that ends in:

index.php?title=Pagename&oldid=12345

Here, 12345 is the revision ID. You can now enter the revision ID (12345) in Special:ChangeAuthor's input box and follow the normal procedure. As a shortcut, you can also go to Special:ChangeAuthor/Main_Page or Special:ChangeAuthor/12345 and bypass the input box altogether.
NOTE: In the event you have both a page called 12345 and a revision ID 12345, you will need to access the page using :12345 (i.e. prepend a colon).

6. THE CHANGEAUTH LOG
Every time someone changes a revision's author, the change appears both in Special:Recentchanges and in the changeauth log. You can access this log through Special:Log/changeauth . Every log entry includes the user who made the change, the revision ID and page the change was made to, and the old and new author of the revision. You can also filter the log by user and by page.

7. LICENSING

8. TRANSLATING CHANGEAUTHOR
