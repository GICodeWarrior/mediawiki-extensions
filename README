# Looking for WikiEditor or Vector extensions? They've been moved to extensions/WikiEditor and extensions/Vector
# respectively. These remaining extensions have been ported to either no longer depend on the now removed code in
# UsabilityInitiative.php. This process has left some of these extensions incompatible with MediaWiki prior to 1.17.
# For 1.16 compatible versions (which are no longer under active development but can be used to fixing bugs on existing
# deployments) please see the branches/usability-initiative-1_16/ (which has the latest patches) or the
# branches/REL1_16/extensions/UsabilityInitiative branches.

# Dependent on 1.17

# * PrefSwitch

# Not dependent on 1.17
