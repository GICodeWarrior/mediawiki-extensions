FirePHP is an extension to Firebug, an awesome debugging extension to Firefox.

It allows pulling debug log data in from your PHP script via HTTP headers,
which then get displayed in Firebug's console along with errors, warnings,
and AJAX hits from the web page.

Please note that a few lines of output won't make it to FirePHP as they are
output either before we've done all plugin initialization, or after we've
flushed output and can no longer add HTTP headers.

This extension requires MediaWiki 1.19 which added the 'Debug' hook.

lib/FirePHP.class.php is BSD-licensed
