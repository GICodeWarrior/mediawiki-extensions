MediaWiki Piwik Integration extension

version 0.2.5rev0.7.5 (1.0-RC1)
07 July 2008

This is the README file for the Piwik Integration extension for MediaWiki
software. The extension is only useful if you've got a MediaWiki
installation; it can only be installed by the administrator of the site.

== Minimum requirements ==

* MediaWiki 1.11+

* A Piwik installation with the site configured

== Installation instructions ==

Please, read them carefully. They're not very difficult to understand,
but ALL steps are necessary:

* Create a folder called "piwik" in your extensions directory

* Upload Piwik.php, Piwik.i18n.php, Piwik_specialpage.php and piwik-mw.js
  to the "piwik" folder you've just created

* Edit your LocalSettings.php and, at the end of the file, add the
  following:

        require_once($IP.'/extensions/piwik/Piwik.php');


* Then, you need to define where Piwik is installed and the "idsite".
  To do it, just add after the require_once:

        $wgPiwikURL = "http://piwik/url/";
        $wgPiwikIDSite = "piwik_idsite";

  Note: Change the value of $wgPiwikURL with the URL where you installed
        Piwik. Remember to add the trailing slash!

        Change the value of $wgPiwikIDSite with the number inside
        "piwik_idsite" in your Piwik code. For example, in:

            <!-- Piwik -->
            <a href="http://piwik.org" title="Web analytics" onclick="window.open(this.href);return(false);">
            <script language="javascript" src="http://piwik/url/piwik.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
            <script type="text/javascript">
            <!--
            piwik_action_name = '';
            piwik_idsite = 1;
            piwik_url = 'http://piwik/url/piwik.php';
            piwik_log(piwik_action_name, piwik_idsite, piwik_url);
            //-->
            </script><object>
            <noscript><p>Web analytics <img src="http://stats.astronomipedia.es/piwik.php" style="border:0" alt="piwik"/></p>
            </noscript></object></a>
            <!-- /Piwik -->

        the $wgPiwikIDSite is 1


* You can also set $wgPiwikCustomJS if you want to add custom javascript
  tags (see http://piwik.org/javascript-tag-documentation/ for further
  information). For example:

            $wgPiwikCustomJS = "piwik_hosts_alias = ["hostname1.com", "hostname2.com"]; // the current tracked website is added to this array anyway
            piwik_install_tracker = 0;"
			
* If you want to change piwik_action_name, you can set $wgPiwikActionName
  inside your LocalSettings.php file.
  
** In case you want to include the piwik_action_name as, for example,
   "wiki/Title of the page", you can set $wgPiwikUsePageTitle to
   true and set $wgPiwikActionName to "wiki/". The extension will print
  
			piwik_action_name = 'wiki/Title of the page';
