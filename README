# AddMediaWizard is dependent on js2 / mwEmbed, you must include js2Support extension 
prior to AddMediaWizard.php

# To enable add the following to localSettings.php 
# JS2 / mwEmbed Support
require_once( "$IP/extensions/JS2Support/JS2Support.php" );
# Add Media Wizard
require_once( "$IP/extensions/AddMediaWizard/AddMediaWizard.php" );

== Recommended Dependencies == 
AddMediaWiard "should work" without these decencies but you will need to be careful in your 
configuration of the extension that you don't request unavailable features

# To support cross-domain contributions to commons you will also need the apiProxy 
javascript module: 
require_once( "$IP/extensions/ApiProxy/ApiProxy.php" );

# To support adding video to pages you will also need the TimedMediaHandler extension: 
require_once( "$IP/extensions/TimedMediaHandler/TimedMediaHandler.php" );
