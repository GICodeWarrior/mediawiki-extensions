== Pre-requisites ==

This extension was tested with Mediawiki 1.8.2.

== Configuration & Installation ==

* Get the source via [http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/trunk/extensions/ImportFreeImages SVN]
* You have to have already set up uploads to work properly on your wiki.
* You may have to manully create the wgTmpDirectory (typically wiki/images/tmp)
* Download and install [http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpflickr phpflickr 2.0] and put it in the directory extensions/ImportFreeImages (so you should have a directory wiki/extensions/phpFlickr-2.0.0). 
* Add this line to your LocalSettings.php
<pre>
require_once('extensions/ImportFreeImages/ImportFreeImages.php');
</pre>
* Get yourself an API Key from [http://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.api_keys.html here] and set $wgIFI_FlickrAPIKey to this key in ImportFreeImages.php.

== Options == 
* Configure $wgResultsPerPage and $wgResultsPerRow if you desire. 
* Change which license photos are searched by changing $wgFlickrLicense, by default it's '4', which is CC Attribution License. See more info [http://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.licenses.getInfo.html here]
* Change how the results are sorted by altering $wgFlickrSort, see more [http://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.search.html here].

== Bugs and enhancements ==

Bugs or feature requests can be sent to the author at travis @ wikihow.com.

Other ideas offering radio buttons and checkboxes to allow users to customize which licenses are searched and how the results are sorted. Other API sources could be added to complement the flickr functionality.
