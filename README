# Looking for WikiEditor or Vector extensions? They've been moved to extensions/WikiEditor and extensions/Vector
# respectively. These remaining extensions are being ported to either no longer depend on the now remove
# UsabilityInitiative.php code or to be made compatible with MediaWiki 1.17. For 1.16 compatible versions (which are no
# longer under active development but can be used to fixing bugs on existing deployments) please see the
# branches/usability-initiative-1_16/ (which has the latest patches) or the
# branches/REL1_16/extensions/UsabilityInitiative branch.

# PROGRESS ON WORK IN PROGRESS:
# * ClickTracking -- complete, depends on MediaWiki 1.17
# * DontSwitchMeOver -- complete, does not depend on MediaWiki 1.17
# * PrefStats -- complete, does not depend on MediaWiki 1.17
# * PrefSwitch -- incomplete/broken
# * UserDailyContribs -- complete, does not depend on MediaWiki 1.17

# Some lines to add to LocalSettings.php to get these extensions up and running:

# PrefStats collects and displays statistics for when users have started/ended using certain options

require_once("$IP/extensions/UsabilityInitiative/PrefStats/PrefStats.php");
$wgPrefStatsTrackPrefs = array( 'skin' => 'vector', 'usebetatoolbar' => 1 );
$wgGroupPermissions['sysop']['prefstats'] = true;
$wgPrefStatsTimeUnit = 60 * 60 * 24;

# UserDailyContribs allows you to track users' contribution totals

require_once( "$IP/extensions/UsabilityInitiative/UserDailyContribs/UserDailyContribs.php" );

# ClickTracking lets you track users' clicks on links/buttons. The current implementation tracks clicks on the
# navigation bar - the WikiEditor toolbar makes use of this if present

require_once("$IP/extensions/UsabilityInitiative/ClickTracking/ClickTracking.php");
// Track 1 in every 10 clicks; set to 1 to track all clicks, -1 to disable
$wgClickTrackThrottle = 10;
