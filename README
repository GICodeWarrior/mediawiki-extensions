== 1. Introduction ==

The new user email notification extension provides a clean and customisable
means to send email messages to one or more registered users upon the creation
of a user account. The behaviour of the extension can be controlled using
configuration options within the LocalSettings.php file for MediaWiki.

== 2. Installation requirements ==

This extension requires MediaWiki 1.8.0 or later.

== 3. Installing the extension ==

To install the extension, place all extension files into a NewUserNotif/
directory within your MediaWiki extensions/ directory, then edit
LocalSettings.php and add the following line

	require_once( "{$IP}/extensions/NewUserNotif/NewUserNotif.php" );

== 4. Editing the notification email ==

When preparing the email message to be sent to each recipient, the extension
relies upon two system messages. You will need to create these if you wish
to customise them, as detailed below:

MediaWiki:Newusernotifsubj
	This file contains the subject line for the email;
	$1 is replaced with the wiki site name from $wgSitename.

MediaWiki:Newusernotifbody
	This file contains the body text for the email.
	$1 is replaced with the username of the recipient;
	$2 is replaced with the username of the new user account;
	$3 is replaced with the wiki site name from $wgSitename;
	$4 is replaced with the time and date of the account's creation.
	$5 is replaced with the date of the account's creation.
	$6 is replaced with the time of the account's creation.


== 5. Configuration ==

The behaviour of the extension can be tweaked using three configuration
variables. To override the defaults for these, set them in LocalSettings.php
underneath the call to the extension file.

$wgNewUserNotifSender
	Email address of the sender of the email
	Defaults to the value of $wgPasswordSender

$wgNewUserNotifTargets
	Array containing the usernames or identifiers of those who should receive
	a notification email. Email will not be sent unless the recipient's
	email address has been validated, where this is required in the site
	configuration.
	
	Defaults to the first user (usually the wiki's primary administrator)
	
$wgNewUserNotifEmailTargets
	Array containing email addresses to which a notification should also be sent
	Defaults to no additional addresses
	
== 6. Advanced Configuration ==

As of version 1.5.2 of this extension, you can customize and add parameters passed to both the subject and body messages in your localsettings.php without modifying the extension code.

You can do this by adding (or changing) parameter values and/or functions that return the desired parameter values to the parameter definition arrays underneath the call to the extension file.  In both cases you can use references to $this, $user (created user object), $recipient (target), or from globals $wfContLang, $wgSitename.  (For advanced techniques and using other globals, see below).

$wgNewUserNotifSenderSubjParam
	The list of evaluated parameters passed to the message subject(MediaWiki:Newusernotifsubj).  Default is:
			'$wgSitename',										// $1 Site Name

$wgNewUserNotifSenderParam
	The list of evaluated parameters passed to the message body(MediaWiki:Newusernotifbody).  Defaults are:
			'$recipient',										// $1 Recipient (of notification message)
			'$user->getname()',									// $2 User Name
			'$wgSitename',										// $3 Site Name
			'$wgContLang->timeAndDate( wfTimestampNow() )',		// $4 Time and date stamp
			'$wgContLang->date( wfTimestampNow() )',			// $5 Date Stamp
			'$wgContLang->time( wfTimestampNow() )',			// $6 Time Stamp

You can then either edit MediaWiki:Newusernotifbody to make use of the new parameters (e.g. add "\n\nThe request came from $7.") or alternatively if you haven't customised the message you can edit NewUserNotif.i18n.php and make the change there to avoid creating a new wiki page (e.g. if your wiki is in English, change the 'en' array.)

=== 6.1 Upgrading from 1.5.1 ===

If you did not customize the passed parameters, this extension works exactly as before and no action need to be taken.

If you added to or changed the default passed parameters, you will need to correspondingly add to or change the corresponding arrays.  You should be able to take the exact same code and add to or replace it in the arrays.

For example, if you added a 7th parameter (in his case, the email address of the new user), you would just add it (in localsettings.php, below the extension reference) like this:

<source lang="php">
$wgNewUserNotifSenderParam[] = '$user->getEmail()';				// $7 new user email address
</source>

The code for the parameter to be passed should be exactly the same (except enclosed in quotes) as it is in your modified wfMsgForContent function call found in private function makeMessage.

=== 6.2 Examples For Adding Additional Parameters ===

Here are some commonly used additional parameter you could add to further customize your notification message subject and body:
<source lang="php">
$wgNewUserNotifSenderParam[] = '$user->getEmail()';				// $7 email
$wgNewUserNotifSenderParam[] = 'rawurlencode($wgSitename)';		// $8 Escaped for email message
$wgNewUserNotifSenderParam[] = 'wfGetIP()';						// $9 Submitter's IP Address
</source>

Of course if you wanted to pass these parameter(s) to the subject message, you would add them to the $wgNewUserNotifSenderSubjParam array instead of the $wgNewUserNotifSenderParam array.

=== 6.4 Some Technique/Tricks for Adding Additional Parameters ===

Let's say you wanted to use a global variable or reference other than $this, $user (created user object), $recipient (target), $wfContLang, or $wgSitename.

You could do so by directly referencing a previously assigned global.  Example:

<source lang="php">
$wgNewUserNotifSenderParam[] = '$GLOBALS["wgUser"]->getEmail()';				// $10 email
</source>

Note:  This isn't the best example, because it would be easier to use the $user object ('$user->getEmail()'), but it gives you an idea how you could reference the global variable (in this case objec) $wgUser directly.

=== 6.5 Advanced Customization Prior to 1.5.2 ===

If you want to change the parameters passed in a version prior to 1.5.2, you would need to modify the extension code directly in  wfMsgForContent function call found in private function makeMessage of NewUserNotif.class.php.
