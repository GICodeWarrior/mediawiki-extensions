This is the readme file for AjaxLogin extension.
The newest documentation for this extension can always be found at
<http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:AjaxLogin>.

==History==
AjaxLogin was written by Inez Korczy≈Ñski <korczynski(at)gmail(dot)com> for Wikia, Inc.

Some code hacks were written by Jack Phoenix <jack@countervandalism.net>.

==License==
GNU General Public License 2.0 or later

==Dependency==
Yahoo! User Interface Library (YUI); see function AjaxLoginJS in AjaxLogin.php.
AjaxLogin calls two YUI .js files which are hosted on Yahoo!'s servers, two YUI .css files, which also are hosted
on Yahoo!'s servers, two of its own .js files and its only .css file.

Please note that AjaxLogin does not work with YUI 2.7.0, hence why it's using 2.6.0's JS files rather than using 2.7.0.

==Manual modifications==
You will need to modify one core MediaWiki file, includes/EditPage.php, if you want users to be able to log in with AjaxLogin
on edit view (?action=edit) without losing their changes.

Find protected function showFormBeforeText() and add this line inside the $wgOut->addHTML() call so that it'll be the first <input> to be added:

	<input type='hidden' value=\"\" name=\"wpLogin\" id=\"wpLogin\" />

==To-do & bugs==
This extension is right now a major hack. It requires YUI and isn't pretty in any case,
but it works and has been tested on MediaWiki 1.14alpha.

The JavaScript file should be rewritten so that the YUI dependency could be removed.
Obviously YAHOOTools.js should also be killed in the process.

Patches are more than welcome and they can be submitted either through Bugzilla <https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org> or emailed to me
<jack@countervandalism.net> directly.
