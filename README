== About ==

Storyboard is an extension developed for the Wikimedia Foundations fundraising efforts.
It allows users to submit stories and can display these in an ajaxscroll board that can
be embedded in wiki articles. The stories can be managed via a story review interface
and be viewed and edited individually on a special story page.
