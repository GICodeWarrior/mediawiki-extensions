This extension adds an experimental time zone picker map to Special:Preference's date/time panel.

PHP's date-and-time functions pass through latitude and longitude coordinates from the system
timezone database, which we use here to plot on a map.

To prune things down, only zone settings that match the currently selected offset are shown
on the map; this lets us show what likely candidates are available that match either the
configured server offset or the browser settings, then pick one from the map.

Selecting a new setting (a specific zone or the server, guess, or other options) from the
drop-down updates the map automatically, and centers the view on the selected offset.

The map can be zoomed in 2x by double-clicking; this may require vertical scrolling in some
instances.

Todo:
* pretty sure server default isn't being handled right if not UTC
* clean up rambling code
* find a cleaner way to get non-current items showing (can show them but it makes the map much busier)
* redo the map refreshes so we're not removing and recreating everything when you click something already on the map!
* make map zoom work on iPad (?)
* show the TZ offset in HH:MM clearly at the top of the map, with selectors to jump over to other zones for browsing :D
* South Pole entry is still a little off
* scroll automatically in zoomed mode
* clearer controls for zoom
* (perhaps) use geolocation info to help pick something

Note on the location information: we do *not* have boundaries available, and even if we did it wouldn't
be wise to use them as borders are in dispute in a number of countries. Available locations are for the
cities that are representative.

The map has a shading overlay that highlights a fairly generic range that approximates the size of a time zone.
