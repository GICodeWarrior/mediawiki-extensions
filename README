We're starting to merge bits from Wikidom and ParserPlayground tests here.
Enjoy!

Short-term work highlights:
* convert parser to wikidom format & using the wikidom serializer
* port/update/write more tests
* Special: page to host the editor as a standalone demo
* Opt-in test mode to switch the editor in on EditPage (initially blank)
* Use serializer to save pages from editor
* Use parser to load pages into editor

Long-term work highlights:
* more thorough & bulk testing
* more extension support
