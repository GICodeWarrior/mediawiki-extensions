This tidy.conf file is used to configure the HTML Tidy executable or
library when $wgUseTidy is enabled in MediaWiki.

As of MediaWiki 1.10, the default is to use includes/tidy.conf, which
is bundled with the main MediaWiki distribution.

A copy remains here in extensions/tidy for backwards compatibility.
