= Semantic Result Formats =

Semantic Result Formats is an extension to MediaWiki that bundles a number of
result formats for Semantic MediaWiki's inline queries. The individual formats
can be added to the installation independently. This file contains an
overview on how to install and configure the formats, as well as an overview
of all included formats.

Semantic Result Formats requires Semantic MediaWiki to run, at least at the
same second level version number as Semantic Result Formats, i.e. SRF 1.4.0
requires SMW 1.4.0.

=== timeline ===
