== About ==

Data Transfer is an extension to MediaWiki that displays XML for the
current contents of the pages of any combination of the wiki's
categories and namespaces. The XML is split into fields based on field
declarations within the page's template calls; any text that is not
within template calls gets placed into one or more "free text" tags.

For more information on Data Transfer, see the extension
homepage at

Notes on installing Data Transfer can be found in the file INSTALL.
