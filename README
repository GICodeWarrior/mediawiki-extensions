MediaWiki extension QPoll, version 0.6.2

This extension allows to create polls embedded into the wikipages. Every poll
may contain a set of the questions of various types. The polls can be "chained"
(when the dependent poll would be available for voting only after a successful
submission of the "dependance" poll). Questions may have various types: with
unique, single or multiple category selections. Categories can be placed into
the groups (metacategories also known as category spans) to make a
"subquestions" inside a question. Optional dependence of the question's
proposal text on the user's choice of category in another previously voted
poll.
