This software is a major rewrite of Evan's original Mediawiki RDF
extension, but based on Dave Becket's librdf (Redland) library, rather than
the PHP native library used in the original.  This allows for a more
RDF-centered approach to data storage among other benefits.

== Pre-requisites ==

* librdf - The redland libraries by David Beckett
* php5-librdf - The redland SWIG-generated PHP libraries
* LibRDF - An objected oriented PHP5 wrapper by David Shea

== Bugs ==

Bugs or feature requests can be sent to the author at
mark@geekhive.net.  The TODO file in this distribution has stuff I
think needs to be todone; + marks show things I've already done, and -
shows things that are yet to be done.
