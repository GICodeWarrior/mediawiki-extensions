Extension:ResumableUpload
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ResumableUpload

Adds resumable upload support to MediaWiki.
Uploads use the existing API but split up files into chunks.
Each chunk is uploaded with an offset to check on the backend that nothing is missing.

This extension needs client JavaScript support.
This can be done with the HTML5 slice api or using the Firefogg extension.


To install this extension, add the following line to your LocalSettings.php file:

require_once( "$IP/extensions/ResumableUpload/ResumableUpload.php" );
