== Overview ==

External Data is an extension to MediaWiki that allows for creating
variables from an external XML or CSV file. It defines two parser functions,
#get_external_data and #external_value:

#get_external_data retrieves the data from a URL that holds XML or CSV,
and assigns it to variables on the page.

#external_value displays the value of any such variable.

== Installation ==

within your MediaWiki 'extensions' directory, then add the following
