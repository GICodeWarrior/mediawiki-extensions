This is an interface to the ICU text transformation/transliteration service.

For some reason some PHP installations need a CXX environment variable to
configure properly:

CXX=g++ ./configure

Not sure if that's my fault or not.

Typical usage:

    $latin = transliterate_with_id('Any-Latin', $foreign);

The last used transliterator is kept open, since opening a new transliterator 
is slow, taking about 2-3ms. So arrange your code to keep multiple calls to 
the same transliterator together. For instance, this code will be slow:

    for ( $names as $name ) {
        transliterate_with_id( 'Any-Latin', $name );
        transliterate_with_id( 'Any-Tamil', $name );
    }

And this code will be fast:

    for ( $names as $name ) {
        transliterate_with_id( 'Any-Latin', $name );
    }
    for ( $names as $name ) {
        transliterate_with_id( 'Any-Tamil', $name );
    }
