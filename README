Invitations Extension
(C) 2007 Andrew Garrett
Some rights are granted under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
&nbsp;See LICENSE for further details.

The Invitations extension allows certain software features to be enabled
&nbsp;only by an invitation, similar to the way in which the use of Google's
 Gmail was propagated.

This extension is not yet complete. While the main code has been completed,
 an interface still needs to be created, and the code needs to be tested.
 The maximum guarantee is that this code is valid PHP.
