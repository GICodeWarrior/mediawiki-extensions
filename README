This extension provides in-browser editing of uploaded SVG files using the very nice
open-source SVG-edit widget:

  http://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/

SVG-edit 2.5.1 is included at present.

Current versions of most major browsers should work except for Internet Explorer
(IE currently requires Chrome Frame plugin, or using the development version of
SVG-edit 2.6 with IE9.)

While the master code for this extension lives in Wikimedia's SVN repository, I also
have a git repo where I may have some experimental branches:

Known bugs:
* Actual editor issues belong upstream: http://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/

Todo:
* add an editor trigger on SVG images visible in regular page views
* allow saving without closing the editor
* autosave & recover drafts
* allow choosing the filename before saving
