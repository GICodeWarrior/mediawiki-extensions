MediaWiki extension EditConflict, version 0.4.2

Some of not so large wikis have much less "number of pages to number of active
users ratio" comparing to large wikis. Thus, edit conflicts occur more often
at such wikis. Moreover, such wikis sometimes have highly experienced / professional
users whose edits are much more valuable than other's edits (especially the
anonymous ones). One may create (or use an existing) user group for such experienced
users, then install this extension to make edits of professional users to have
less probability of conflicting to other's edits.
