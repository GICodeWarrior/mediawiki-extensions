This extension provides in-browser editing of uploaded SVG files using the very nice
open-source SVG-edit widget:

  http://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/

SVG-edit 2.5.1 is included at present.

Current versions of most major browsers should work except for Internet Explorer
(IE currently requires Chrome Frame plugin, though native IE9 support should come
with upstream updates.)

While the master code for this extension lives in Wikimedia's SVN repository, I also
have a git repo where I may have some experimental branches:

Known bugs:
* Actual editor issues belong upstream: http://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/
* open seems to have some race conditions (sometimes doesn't load the initial file)
* save-and-close seems to have some race conditions (sometimes shows a 'sure you want to leave?' prompt)
* doesn't check if your browser supports SVG before offering the edit button

Todo:
* add an editor trigger on SVG images visible in regular page views
* allow saving without closing the editor
* allow user to write their own edit summary
* autosave & recover drafts
* editor toolbar button to open the editor with a fresh canvas and insert the saved file
* ability to use offsite copy of svg-edit so the whole blob doesn't need to be shipped
