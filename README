ICP agent can be used as ICP responder in squid-apache web server cluster.
It does delay requests to frontend caches 
at high loads and might be remotely turned 
on or off.

Options:
-d      - daemonize
-m      - enable remote management
-p #    - port number to listen at
-h ip   - IP to bind at 
-t #    - static delay time in milliseconds, defaults to 5.0
	  use negative number to send icp misses only
          supports 0.1ms adjustments by varying the response times over ten
          requests +/- 1ms to get the desired average.
-r      - reply only to every nth query
          Useful to dampen responses at very high request rates
          set to something like 1/3 the total number of machines

Example of remote management:

echoping -i agent://enable webserver:3130
echoping -i agent://disable webserver:3130
