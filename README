This extension provides in-browser editing of uploaded SVG files using the very nice
open-source SVG-edit widget:

  http://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/

SVG-edit 2.5.1 is included at present.

Current versions of most major browsers should work except for Internet Explorer
(IE currently requires Chrome Frame plugin, though native IE9 support should come
with upstream updates.)

While the master code for this extension lives in Wikimedia's SVN repository, I also
have a git repo where I may have some experimental branches:

Known bugs:
* Actual editor issues belong upstream: http://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/
* open seems to have some race conditions (sometimes doesn't load the initial file)

Todo:
* add an editor trigger on SVG images visible in regular page views
* allow saving without closing the editor
* autosave & recover drafts
* editor toolbar button to open the editor with a fresh canvas and insert the saved file
