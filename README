!!!!!!!!!! WARNING !!!!!!!!!!

EXTENSION STILL EXPERIMENTAL
USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK

!!!!!!!! END WARNING !!!!!!!!

== Installation ==

This extension is intented to allow to customize the wiki settings whitout
needing to edit the LocalSettings.php file. To enable it, simple include the
Configure.php file in... LocalSettings.php (should be the last time you need
to edit that file :), but also you will need to call the efConfigureSetup()
function in LocalSettings.php because you may want to customize some settings
of the extension and to prevent an attack, the settings have to be always
defined (this is done by including the Configure.php file), even if they won't
be changed because they can arbitrary be set if the register_globals feature of
PHP is turned on.
The default code you can add to your LocalSettings.php is the following:

require_once( "$IP/extensions/Configure/Configure.php" );
efConfigureSetup();

== Configuration ==

The extension will require a directory to store the configuration and this
directory have to be writable by the web server. The default path is the
$IP/serialized directory, that means the "serialized" directory in the wiki
root path. You can change it in $wgConfigureFilesPath. Don't forget to override
this variable between the time you include the Configure.php file and the time
you call efConfigureSetup(), otherwise your changes won't be used.

Note: on MediaWiki < 1.13, serialized directory is publicly viewable, and users
will be able to see the whole configuration, so PLEASE MAKE IT UNREADABLE BY
WEB USERS OR CHANGE IT TO A DIRECTORY THAT ISN'T ACCESSIBLE VIA THE WEB.
YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

You can change the settings in Special:Configure. By default this page is only
accessible by bureaucrat. You can change this by granting the 'configure' right
to any group. This right allow to change only "common" settings. If you want to
be able to change all settings, you will need to have the 'configure-all' right.
This right allow to change some specific settings, like paths, database settings
(all what need also "external" changes, i.e. server rewrite rules, squid
configuration, ...) but also $wgGroupPermission.

Although this extension allows you to configure all settings, it's recommended
to keep the original LocalSettings.php file. You can simply add the extension
after the default settings. If you don't want a setting to be modified, simply
redeclare it after calling efConfigureSetup(), it will still be customizable in
Special:Configure but changes won't have any effect.

This extension uses an extended class of SiteConfiguration, for "normal"
installation, it isn't useful, but for some wiki farms, it will allow to
multiple with only one copy of the software. To change the configuration you
want to load, pass an argument to efConfigureSetup(). A user with
'configure-all' right will also be able to change any configuration.

== Troubleshooting ==

If an admin changed the settings in a way that the wiki can't work anymore,
you can simply drop the conf-now.ser file you'll find in $wgConfigureFilesPath
directory. Then it will fall back to the default configuration that is in
LocalSettings.php. It's why it's important to keep that file.

== To do ==

* Some settings are still uneditable because of their array usage, this will
  need to develop some specific method to change them.
* It is already possible to rollback to an earlier version of the configuration
  by editing it and saving, but i think an diff possibility would be nice to see
  which changes were made between versions. 
* Support extensions
* Many other things, if i have time :)
