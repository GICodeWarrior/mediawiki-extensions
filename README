This extension provides a media handler for the Ogg container format. When
enabled, a player will be automatically embedded in the image description page, 
or any wiki page using the same syntax as for images. 

To install this extension, add the following to the end of your LocalSettings.php:

    require( "$IP/extensions/OggHandler/OggHandler.php" );

You will also need a copy of ffmpeg on the server. You can get it from:

    http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/

Set the binary location with:

    $wgFFmpegLocation = '/path/to/ffmpeg';

after the require line above. 

The bundled Cortado player is licensed under the GPL, the source is available from:

    http://www.flumotion.net/cortado/

The PEAR directory contains a fork of the File_Ogg package, licensed under the
LGPL. The stock File_Ogg will not work -- I have made many aggressive changes
including support for stream formats other than Vorbis. I'll try to get my
changes committed to the official PEAR tree at some point in the future.
