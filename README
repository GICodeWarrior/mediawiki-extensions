# ClickTracking lets you track users' clicks on links/buttons. The current implementation tracks clicks on the
# navigation bar - the WikiEditor toolbar makes use of this if present

# This extension requires MediaWiki 1.17+ because it makes use of ResourceLoader.

# Example LocalSettings.php additions

# to track a dynamic action, be sure that $j.trackAction("something to identify action") is called in JS
# to track an action that has state information associated with it, fire $j.trackActionWithInfo("action", "state information");

// Track 1 in every 10 clicks; set to 1 to track all clicks, -1 to disable
