Make Flash video (.flv files) behave just like any other image uploaded to the
wiki.  Videos can be inserted as [[Image:Movie.flv]], made part of image
galleries, etc.

See http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:FlvHandler for full instructions.

Briefly:

  1. Make sure ffmpeg is available on your web host to generate the thumbnails.

  2. Add to LocalSettings.php:

    $wgFileExtensions[] = 'flv'; // Allow .flv files to be uploaded
    include_once("$IP/extensions/FlvHandler/FlvHandler.php");

  3. Download flowplayer v3.0.3 (http://www.flowplayer.org/) and unzip it into
     extensions/FlvHandler/flowplayer/
