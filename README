This extension allows users to create client side graphs (like pie, bar, etc)
from data using javascript. The javascript is created by sysops in the
MediaWiki namespace. Adding new scripts works like the Gadgets extension (as
this extension borrows heavily from Gadgets).

Preprocessing scripts, and plotting scripts are available, and the javascript
function for each should be defined as follows:

/* For preprocessing scripts */
function plotter_<functionname>_process( data, labels, arg1, arg2, ... ) {
        ...
}

/* For plotting scripts */
function plotter_<functionname>_draw( data, labels, arg1, arg2, ... ) {
        ...
}

You can use these in a parser function like so:

{{#plot:
|script=<functionname>
|scriptarguments=arg1,arg2,...
|labels=label1,label2
|data=1,2
2,4}}

Currently, only PlotKit, and generic canvas drawing is supported; but other javascript plotting libraries
will be supported in the future.

This code is very alpha quality right now; many features may not work.
