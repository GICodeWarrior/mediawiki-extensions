MediaWiki extension WikiSync, version 0.3.2

WikiSync allows an AJAX-based synchronization of revisions and files between
global wiki site and it's local mirror. Files download can optionally be disabled,
to speed up the synchronization. The process is partially automatized, and
progress indicator is displayed during time-consuming operations. Please
use not too old (IE8+, FF3+) browser for client interface and client scripts, as
it's not been tested with old browsers.

See http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:WikiSync for further details.
