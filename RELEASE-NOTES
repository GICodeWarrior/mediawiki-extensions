 Changelog:
 ==========

 * (trunk) -- Version 2.0
   This release is built upon 1.4 alpha. See changes of 1.4 alpha as well.
   'ArrayExtension' is now simply called 'Arrays'. Therefore you have to adjust your LocalSettings.php.
    - class 'ArrayExtension' renamed to 'ExtArrays'
    - '#arrayindex' will only expand options/default when required.
    - '#arraymerge', '#arrayunion', '#arraydiff' and '#arrayintersect' can handle multiple arrays now.
    - Compatibility mode variable '$egArrayExtensionCompatbilityMode' is set to false by default. See
      Version 1.4 alpha for further information. Further changes to the compatibility mode behavior
      in version 2.0:
      + '#arrayindex' will return its default also in case of existing index but empty value. This
        makes the function consistent with Variables '#var' and hash tables '#hashvalue'.
      + '#arraymerge', '#arrayunion', '#arraydiff' and '#arrayintersect' with only one array for
        the operation will make a copy of that array instead of creating no array at all.
      + See 1.4 alpha for previous changes
    - '#arraydefine' option 'print' no longer supports 'print=print' and parameters beyond options.
      This functionality never worked reliably anyways. 'print=list' still works.
    - If 'Regex Fun' extension is installed, '#arraysearcharray' can use Regex Funs 'e' flag feature
      for transforming the result and at the same time parsing them after each back-reference inclusion.
    - 1.4 alpha bug solved, '#arraysearcharray' with empty string as start index was interpreted as 0


 * November 20, 2001 -- Version 1.4 alpha (r103716)
    This release introduces some useful bugfixes and optional new behavior for various functionality.
    This version never made it into a final stage because version 2.0 will introduce some rather
    radical changes, so this alpha release allows to profit from bugfixes that might be quite useful
    if you don't want to use Version 2.0 for some reason.
    - Configuration variable '$egArrayExtensionCompatbilityMode' for deactivating the following newly
      introduced breaking changes:
      + '#arrayprint' no longer returns an error text in case the array doesn't exist.
      + '#arrayreset' now uses n parameters instead of ',' as separator for n arrays to reset
      + '#arrayindex' options removed, instead third parameter simply is the default value (without
        any 'default=' in front).
      + '#arraysearch' returns an empty string '' instead of '-1' in case nothing was found.
      + '#arraysearcharray' and '#arrayslice' without all necessary parameters set will always create
        a new empty array.
      Compatibility mode is active by default. In Version 2.0 it will be set to inactive by default.
    - '#arraysearch' will only expand 'yes' or 'no' if given, but never both.
    - negative indexes for '#arrayindex', '#arraysearch' and '#arraysearcharray' are possible now.
    - bugfix in '#arraysearcharray', index and limit working fine now.
    - arrayprint will handle <includeonly>/<noinclude> correct in case it's used in a template.
    - Internationalization for several languages added.	
    - moved into mediawiki.org svn repository.
    
    @ToDo before release:
    - As in Variables 2.0, one store per Parser should be used.
    - ''#arraysearch'' should not expand both, 'yes' and 'no', just the one actual case.
    - Further breaking changes fixing weird old behavior and functionality

     print=( "list" ). Options are diliminated by comma, e.g. "unique, sort=desc,print=list". 
   - fixed bug in arrayslice (offset can be greater than array size): if offset is no less than array
     size, empty array will be returned, if offset if no greater than negative array size, a new array
     with all elements will be returned
   - update arrayindex by adding print option when (i) the array is not defined; (ii) the index is not
     valid in the specified array: e.g. "default=bad array"
