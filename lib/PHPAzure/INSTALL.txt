INSTALLATION
------------

Windows Azure SDK for PHP requires no special installation steps. Simply download the SDK,
extract it to the folder you would like to keep it in, and add the library directory
to your PHP include_path.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
-------------------

Windows Azure SDK for PHP requires PHP 5.2.4 or later.

CONFIGURING THE INCLUDE PATH
----------------------------

Once you have a copy of Windows Azure SDK for PHP available, your application will need to
access the SDK classes. Though there are several ways to achieve this, your PHP include_path
needs to contain the path to the Windows Azure SDK for PHP classes under the /library
directory in this distribution. You can find out more about the PHP include_path
configuration directive here:
