_DefaultChoice: en (English)[ default language ]
_Description: Languages to support:
 For each supported language, Mailman stores default language
 specific texts in /etc/mailman/LANG/ giving them conffile like
 treatment with the help of ucf.  This means approximately 150kB for
 each supported language on the root file system.
 .
 If you need a different set of languages at a later time, just run
 dpkg-reconfigure mailman.
 .
 NOTE: Languages enabled on existing mailing lists are forcibly
 re-enabled when deselected and mailman needs at least one language for
 displaying its messages.

Template: mailman/used_languages
Type: string
Description: for internal use: holding result of scan

Template: mailman/gate_news
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Gate news to mail?
 Mailman allows to gate news to mail, that is, send all the messages
 which appear in a Usenet newsgroup to a mailing list.
 .
 Most people won't need this.

Template: mailman/create_site_list
Type: note
_Description: Missing site list
 Mailman needs a so-called "site list", which is the list from which
 password reminders and such are sent out from.  This list needs to be
 created before mailman will start.
 .
 To create the list, run "newlist mailman" and follow the instructions
 on-screen.  Note that you also need to start mailman after that,
 using /etc/init.d/mailman start.

_Description: Default language for Mailman:
 The web page will be shown in this language, and in general, Mailman
 will use this language to communicate with the user.

Template: mailman/queue_files_present
Type: note
_Description: Old queue files present
 The directory /var/lib/mailman/qfiles contains files. It needs to be
 empty for the upgrade to work properly. You can try to handle them by:
  - Stop new messages from coming in (at the MTA level).
  - Start a mailman queue runner: /etc/init.d/mailman start
  - Let it run until all messages are handled.
    If they don't all get handled in a timely manner, look at the logs
    to try to understand why and solve the cause.
  - Stop it: /etc/init.d/mailman stop
  - Retry the upgrade.
  - Let messages come in again.
 You can also decide to simply remove the files, which will make
 Mailman forget about (and lose) the corresponding emails.
 .
 If these files correspond to shunted messages, you have to either
 delete them or unshunt them (with /var/lib/mailman/bin/unshunt).
 Shunted messages are messages on which Mailman has already abandoned
 any further processing because of an error condition, but that are
 kept for admin review. You can use /var/lib/mailman/bin/show_qfiles to
 examine the contents of the queues.
