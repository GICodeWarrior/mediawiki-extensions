Template: mailman/site_languages
Type: multiselect
__Choices: big5, ca, cs, da, de, en, es, et, eu, fi, fr, hr, hu, it, ja, ko, lt, nl, no, pl, pt, pt_BR, ro, ru, sl, sr, sv, uk
Default: en
_Description: Which languages to support?
 For each supported language Debian Mailman stores default language
 specific texts in /etc/mailman/LANG/ giving them conffile like
 treatment with the help of ucf.  This means approximately 150kB for
 each supported language on the root FS.
 .
 If you need a different set of languages at a later time, just run
 dpkg-reconfigure mailman.
 .
 NOTE: Languages enabled on existing mailing lists are forcibly
 re-enabled when deselected and mailman needs at least one language for
 displaying its messages.

Template: mailman/used_languages
Type: string
Description: Internal holding result of scan

Template: mailman/gate_news
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Gate news to mail?
 Do you want to gate news to mail, that is, send all the messages which
 appear in a newsgroup to a mailing list.
 .
 Most people won't need this.

Template: mailman/create_site_list
Type: note
_Description: Missing site list
 Mailman needs a so-called "site list", which is the list from which
 password reminders and such are sent out from.  This list needs to be
 created before mailman will start.
 .
 To create the list, run "newlist mailman" and follow the instructions
 on-screen.  Note that you also need to start mailman after that,
 using /etc/init.d/mailman start.

Template: mailman/default_server_language
Type: select
Choices: ${site_languages}
_Description: Which language should be the default for Mailman?
 The web page will be shown in this language, and in general, Mailman
 will use this language to communicate with the user.

Template: mailman/queue_files_present
Type: note
_Description: Old queue files present
 The directory /var/lib/mailman/qfiles contains files. It needs to be
 empty for the upgrade to work properly. If these files contain
 unprocessed messages that are otherwise fine, then you can try to
 handle them by:
  - Stopping new messages from coming in the queue (at the MTA level:
    queue them in the MTA's queue or refuse them with a 4xx code). If
    your site has a relatively low mailman traffic, you can skip this
    step.
  - Start a mailman queue runner: /etc/init.d/mailman start
  - Let it run until all messages are handled.
    If they don't all get handled in a timely manner, look at the logs
    to try to understand why and solve the cause.
  - Stop it: /etc/init.d/mailman stop
  - Retry the upgrade.
  - Let messages come in again.
 You can also decide to simply remove the files, which will make
 Mailman forget about (and lose) the corresponding emails; expect
 angry users.
 .
 If these files correspond to shunted messages, you have to either
 delete them or unshunt them (with
 /var/lib/mailman/bin/unshunt). Shunted messages are messages on which
 Mailman has already abandoned any further processing because of an
 error condition, but that are kept for admin review, as they usually
 originate from Mailman bugs or other abnormal situations that need
 human inspection. You can use /var/lib/mailman/bin/show_qfiles to
 examine the contents of the queues.

Template: mailman/update_aliases
Type: note
_Description: Administrator must update aliases
 The aliases you need for mailman in your MTA's configuration have
 changed. Please run /var/lib/mailman/bin/genaliases to see the new
 aliases you need.
 .
 Until you do that, some features will stop working and mails will go
 out with an invalid Return-Path.

Template: mailman/update_passwords
Type: note
_Description: List passwords broken
 List admin and moderator passwords are broken by this upgrade. Use
 /var/lib/mailman/bin/change_pw to have new ones automatically
 generated and emailed to the admins and moderators.
