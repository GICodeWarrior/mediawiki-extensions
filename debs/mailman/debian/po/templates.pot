"The directory /var/lib/mailman/qfiles contains files. It needs to be empty "

" - Stopping new messages from coming in the queue (at the MTA level:\n"
"   queue them in the MTA's queue or refuse them with a 4xx code). If\n"
"   your site has a relatively low mailman traffic, you can skip this\n"
"   step.\n"
" - Start a mailman queue runner: /etc/init.d/mailman start\n"
" - Let it run until all messages are handled.\n"
"   If they don't all get handled in a timely manner, look at the logs\n"
"   to try to understand why and solve the cause.\n"
" - Stop it: /etc/init.d/mailman stop\n"
" - Retry the upgrade.\n"
" - Let messages come in again.\n"

"are messages on which Mailman has already abandoned any further processing "
"because of an error condition, but that are kept for admin review, as they "
"usually originate from Mailman bugs or other abnormal situations that need "
"human inspection. You can use /var/lib/mailman/bin/show_qfiles to examine "
