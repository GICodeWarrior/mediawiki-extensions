php5 (5.1.6-5) unstable; urgency=low

  the debian php packages now support a modular configuration layout.

  if you have previously installed modules that have put entries in
  your php.ini file, you will probably be getting various warning
  messages about duplicate modules if you have error reporting enabled
  with a mask including E_WARN.

  no attempt will be made to muck further with your php.ini file, so you
  should remove those lines yourself.
