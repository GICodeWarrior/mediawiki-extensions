imagemagick (7:6.5.5.3-1exp1) experimental; urgency=low

  The SVG, WMF, OpenEXR, DjVu and Graphviz coders have been moved to a new
  package, libmagickcore3-extra. In order to use some of these coders with
  ImageMagick you will need to install it (if recommended packages aren't
  installed by default in your system).
