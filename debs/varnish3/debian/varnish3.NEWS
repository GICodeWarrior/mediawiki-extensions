varnish (2.1.3-2) lucid; urgency=low

  Varnish will no longer start by default when installed.  Edit
  /etc/default/varnish, and set START=yes to enable varnishd at boot.

  This may also affect you after upgrading if you never have changed
  /etc/default/varnish, or if you accepted changes to /etc/default/varnish
  during upgrade.

varnish (2.1.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  Varnish 2.1.0 provides authentication for the management port.  The
  packaging defaults now use this functionality.

  The secret is used by "varnishd" and "varnishadm", and is stored in
  the file /etc/varnish/secret by default.  This file has been created
  for you by the post installation script.

  If you use varnishadm manually to manage your varnish instance, or
  have changed /etc/default/varnish, you will need to add the option
  "-S /etc/varnish/secret" to "varnishd" and "varnishadm".
