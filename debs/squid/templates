Template: squid/http_anonymizer
Type: note
_Description: The http_anonymizer directive has been replaced with header_replace and header_access.
 The http_anonymizer directive that was present in squid 2.1 and 2.2
 doesn't exist anymore in squid 2.3 and up. It has been replaced with
 header_replace and header_access that provide more fine-grained control over
 HTTP headers. Right now, your squid doesn't anonymize the HTTP
 headers anymore so you probably want to fix this. The new format is
 explained in the new 2.5 config file, of which you probably have a copy in
 /usr/share/doc/squid/examples/squid.conf.

Template: squid/anonymize_headers
Type: note
_Description: The anonymize_headers and fake_user_agent directives have been replaced with header_access and header_replace.
 The anonymize_headers and fake_user_agent directives that were present in squid 2.3 and 2.4 don't exist anymore in squid 2.5 and up. They have been replaced 
 with header_replace and header_access that provide more fine-grained control 
 over HTTP headers. Right now, your squid doesn't anonymize the HTTP
 headers anymore so you probably want to fix this. The new format is
 explained in the new 2.5 config file, of which you probably have a copy in
 /usr/share/doc/squid/examples/squid.conf.

Template: squid/old_version
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: There is no automatic upgrade path to squid 2.5.
              SQUID 2.5 INSTALLATION WARNING
 .
 You are upgrading squid from an 1.x version to the 2.5 version. The 1.x
 and 2.5 versions are NOT compatible. The structure of the cache directory
 is different and the configuration file "squid.conf" is not entirely
 compatible.
 .
 If you have an old cache directory, please quit NOW and remove the old
 cache by hand (in /var/spool/squid). Then re-install this squid version.
 .
 Also, please accept the new configuration file. After upgrading your old
 configuration file can be found in "/etc/squid.conf.dpkg-old". Then you
 have to edit the new configuration file by hand to match your old
 configuration.
 .
 Do you want to quit now?

Template: squid-cgi/cachemgr
Type: note
_Description: squid-cgi now uses config file for target ACL
 squid-cgi now checks a configuration file before connecting to the target
 host. Only allowed target will be contacted. Please add hosts you want to
 access to the file /etc/squid/cachemgr.conf, one per line in the form
 .
   hostname:port

Template: squid/fix_lines
Type: boolean
Default: true
_Description: Upgrade squid.conf automatically?
 Incompatible settings have been found in the existing squid.conf file;
 they will prevent squid from starting or working correctly. However, this
 setup can try to modify them to work again. Do you want to apply the
 changes?

Template: squid/authenticate_program
Type: note
_Description: The authenticate_program directive has been replaced with auth_param.
 The authenticate_program directive that was present in squid <= 2.4
 doesn't exist anymore in squid 2.5 and up. All authentication directives
 have been replaced with auth_param. Right now, your squid doesn't
 authenticate users anymore so you probably want to fix this. The new
 format is explained in the new 2.5 config file, of which you probably have
 a copy in /usr/share/doc/squid/examples/squid.conf.

Template: squid/largefiles_warning
Type: note
_Description: Warning: squid may crash when logfiles size is bigger than 2GB.
 Squid may crash if any of the logfiles grows bigger than 2GB. Please
 configure /etc/logrotate.d/squid accordingly to your site's traffic.

Template: squid/fix_cachedir_perms
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Fix permissions of cache_dir?
 Values for cache_effective_user and/or cache_effective_group in config file 
 are incompatible with owner/group of cache directories. Do you want to
 automatically fix permissions on cache directory?
 .
 WARNING: If you specified a cache directory different from /var/spool/squid
 and selected some other directory used by other programs (e.g. /tmp), this
 could affect those programs.
