<H2><A NAME="ss18.1">18.1</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc18.1">Does Squid support SNMP?</A>
</H2>

<P>True SNMP support is available in squid 2 and above. A significant change in the implimentation
occured starting with the development 2.2 code. Therefore there are two sets of instructions
on how to configure SNMP in squid, please make sure that you follow the correct one.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss18.2">18.2</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc18.2">Enabling SNMP in Squid</A>
</H2>

<P>To use SNMP, it must first be enabled with the <EM>configure</EM> script,
and squid rebuilt. To enable is first run the script:
<PRE>
        ./configure --enable-snmp  [ ... other configure options ]
</PRE>

Next, recompile after cleaning the source tree :
<PRE>
        make clean
        make all
        make install
</PRE>

Once the compile is completed and the new binary is installed the <EM>squid.conf</EM> file
needs to be configured to allow access; the default is to deny all requests. The
instructions on how to do this have been broken into two parts, the first for all versions
of Squid from 2.2 onwards and the second for 2.1 and below.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss18.3">18.3</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc18.3">Configuring Squid 2.2</A>
</H2>

<P>To configure SNMP first specify a list of communities that you would like to allow access
by using a standard acl of the form:
<PRE>
        acl aclname snmp_community string
</PRE>

For example:
<PRE>
        acl snmppublic snmp_community public
        acl snmpjoebloggs snmp_community joebloggs
</PRE>

This creates two acl's, with two different communities, public and joebloggs. You can
name the acl's and the community strings anything that you like.</P>

<P>To specify the port that the agent will listen on modify the "snmp_port" parameter,
it is defaulted to 3401. The port that the agent will forward requests that can
not be furfilled by this agent to is set by "forward_snmpd_port" it is defaulted
to off. It must be configured for this to work. Remember that as the requests will
be originating from this agent you will need to make sure that you configure
your access accordingly.</P>

<P>To allow access to Squid's SNMP agent, define an <EM>snmp_access</EM> ACL with the community
strings that you previously defined.
For example:
<PRE>
        snmp_access allow snmppublic localhost
        snmp_access deny all
</PRE>

The above will allow anyone on the localhost who uses the community <EM>public</EM> to
access the agent. It will deny all others access.</P>

<P>If you do not define any <EM>snmp_access</EM> ACL's, then
SNMP access is denied by default.</P>

<P>Finally squid allows to you to configure the address that the agent will bind to
for incomming and outgoing traffic. These are defaulted to 0.0.0.0, changing these
will cause the agent to bind to a specific address on the host, rather than the
default which is all.
<PRE>
        snmp_incoming_address 0.0.0.0
        snmp_outgoing_address 0.0.0.0
</PRE>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss18.4">18.4</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc18.4">Configuring Squid 2.1</A>
</H2>

<P>Prior to Squid 2.1 the SNMP code had a number of issues with the ACL's. If you are
a frequent user of SNMP with Squid, please upgrade to 2.2 or higher.</P>

<P>A sort of default, working configuration is:
<PRE>
        snmp_port 3401
        snmp_mib_path /local/squid/etc/mib.txt

        snmp_agent_conf view all .1.3.6 included
        snmp_agent_conf view squid .1.3.6 included
        snmp_agent_conf user squid - all all public
        snmp_agent_conf user all all all all  squid
        snmp_agent_conf community public squid squid
        snmp_agent_conf community readwrite all all
</PRE>
</P>
<P>Note that for security you are advised to restrict SNMP access to your
caches. You can do this easily as follows:
<PRE>
        acl snmpmanagementhosts 1.2.3.4/255.255.255.255 1.2.3.0/255.255.255.0
        snmp_acl public deny all !snmpmanagementhosts
        snmp_acl readwrite deny all
</PRE>

You must follow these instructions for 2.1 and below exactly or you are
likely to have problems. The parser has some issues which have been corrected
in 2.2.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss18.5">18.5</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc18.5">How can I query the Squid SNMP Agent</A>
</H2>

<P>You can test if your Squid supports SNMP with the <EM>snmpwalk</EM> program
(<EM>snmpwalk</EM> is a part of the
<A HREF="http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/">NET-SNMP project</A>).
Note that you have to specify the SNMP port, which in Squid defaults to
3401.
<PRE>
        snmpwalk -p 3401 hostname communitystring .1.3.6.1.4.1.3495.1.1
</PRE>

If it gives output like:
<PRE>
        enterprises.nlanr.squid.cacheSystem.cacheSysVMsize = 7970816
        enterprises.nlanr.squid.cacheSystem.cacheSysStorage = 2796142
        enterprises.nlanr.squid.cacheSystem.cacheUptime = Timeticks: (766299) 2:07:42.99
</PRE>

then it is working ok, and you should be able to make nice statistics out of it.</P>

<P>For an explanation of what every string (OID) does, you should
refer to the 
<A HREF="/SNMP/">Squid SNMP web pages</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss18.6">18.6</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc18.6">What can I use SNMP and Squid for?</A>
</H2>

<P>There are a lot of things you can do with SNMP and Squid. It can be useful
in some extent for a longer term overview of how your proxy is doing. It can
also be used as a problem solver. For example: how is it going with your
filedescriptor usage? or how much does your LRU vary along a day. Things
you can't monitor very well normally, aside from clicking at the cachemgr
frequently. Why not let MRTG do it for you?</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss18.7">18.7</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc18.7">How can I use SNMP with Squid?</A>
</H2>

<P>There are a number of tools that you can use to monitor Squid via
SNMP.  Many people use MRTG.  Another good combination is 
<A HREF="http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/">NET-SNMP</A> plus 
<A HREF="http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~oetiker/webtools/rrdtool/">RRDTool</A>.  You might be able to find more
information at the 
<A HREF="/SNMP/">Squid SNMP web pages</A> or
