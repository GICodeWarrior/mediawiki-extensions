<H2><A NAME="ss13.1">13.1</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc13.1">What is Multicast?</A>
</H2>

<P>Multicast is essentially the ability to send one IP packet to multiple
receivers.  Multicast is often used for audio and video conferencing systems.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss13.2">13.2</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc13.2">How do I know if my network has multicast?</A>
</H2>

<P>One way is to ask someone who manages your network.  If your network manager
doesn't know, or looks at you funny, then you probably don't have it.</P>

<P>Another way is to use the <EM>mtrace</EM> program, which can be found
on the 
<A HREF="ftp://parcftp.xerox.com/pub/net-research/ipmulti/">Xerox PARC FTP site</A>.  Mtrace is similar to traceroute.  It will
tell you about the multicast path between your site and another.  For example:
<PRE>
        > mtrace mbone.ucar.edu
        mtrace: WARNING: no multicast group specified, so no statistics printed
        Mtrace from 128.117.64.29 to 192.172.226.25 via group 224.2.0.1

<H2><A NAME="ss13.3">13.3</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc13.3">Should I be using Multicast ICP?</A>
</H2>

<P>Short answer: No, probably not.</P>

<P>Reasons why you SHOULD use Multicast:
<OL>
<LI>It reduces the number of times Squid calls <EM>sendto()</EM> to put a UDP
packet onto the network.</LI>
<LI>Its trendy and cool to use Multicast.</LI>
</OL>
</P>

<P>Reasons why you SHOULD NOT use Multicast:
<OL>
<LI>Multicast tunnels/configurations/infrastructure are often unstable.
You may lose multicast connectivity but still have unicast connectivity.</LI>
<LI>Multicast does not simplify your Squid configuration file.  Every trusted
neighbor cache must still be specified.</LI>
<LI>Multicast does not reduce the number of ICP replies being sent around.
It does reduce the number of ICP queries sent, but not the number of replies.</LI>
<LI>Multicast exposes your cache to some privacy issues.  There are no special
emissions required to join a multicast group.  Anyone may join your
group and eavesdrop on ICP query messages.  However, the scope of your
multicast traffic can be controlled such that it does not exceed certain
boundaries.</LI>
</OL>
</P>

<P>We only recommend people to use Multicast ICP over network
infrastructure which they have close control over.  In other words, only
use Multicast over your local area network, or maybe your wide area
network if you are an ISP.  We think it is probably a bad idea to use
Multicast ICP over congested links or commodity backbones.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss13.4">13.4</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc13.4">How do I configure Squid to send Multicast ICP queries?</A>
</H2>

<P>To configure Squid to send ICP queries to a Multicast address, you
need to create another neighbour cache entry specified as <EM>multicast</EM>.
For example:
<PRE>
        cache_peer 224.9.9.9 multicast 3128 3130 ttl=64
</PRE>

224.9.9.9 is a sample multicast group address.
<EM>multicast</EM> indicates that this
is a special type of neighbour.  The HTTP-port argument (3128)
is ignored for multicast peers, but the ICP-port (3130) is
very important.  The final argument, <EM>ttl=64</EM>
specifies the multicast TTL value for queries sent to this
address.
It is probably a good
idea to increment the minimum TTL by a few to provide a margin
for error and changing conditions.</P>

<P>You must also specify which of your neighbours will respond
to your multicast queries, since it would
be a bad idea to implicitly trust any ICP reply from an unknown
address.  Note that ICP replies are sent back to <EM>unicast</EM>
addresses; they are NOT multicast, so Squid has no indication
whether a reply is from a regular query or a multicast
query.  To configure your multicast group neighbours, use the
<EM>cache_peer</EM> directive and the <EM>multicast-responder</EM>
option:
<PRE>
        cache_peer cache1 sibling 3128 3130 multicast-responder
        cache_peer cache2 sibling 3128 3130 multicast-responder
</PRE>

Here all fields are relevant.  The ICP port number (3130)
must be the same as in the <EM>cache_peer</EM> line defining the
multicast peer above.  The third field must either be
<EM>parent</EM> or <EM>sibling</EM> to indicate how Squid should treat replies.
With the <EM>multicast-responder</EM> flag set for a peer,
Squid will NOT send ICP queries to it directly (i.e. unicast).</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss13.5">13.5</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc13.5">How do I know what Multicast TTL to use?</A>
</H2>

<P>The Multicast TTL (which is specified on the <EM>cache_peer</EM> line
of your multicast group) determines how ``far'' your ICP queries
will go.  In the Mbone, there is a certain TTL threshold defined
for each network interface or tunnel.  A multicast packet's TTL must
be larger than the defined TTL for that packet to be forwarded across
that link.  For example, the <EM>mrouted</EM> manual page recommends:
<PRE>
        32   for links that separate sites within an organization.
        64   for links that separate communities or organizations, and are
             attached to the Internet MBONE.
        128  for links that separate continents on the MBONE.
</PRE>
</P>

<P>A good way to determine the TTL you need is to run <EM>mtrace</EM> as shown above
and look at the last line.  It will show you the minimum TTL required to
reach the other host.</P>

<P>If you set you TTL too high, then your ICP messages may travel ``too far''
and will be subject to eavesdropping by others.
If you're only using multicast on your LAN, as we suggest, then your TTL will
be quite small, for example <EM>ttl=4</EM>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss13.6">13.6</A> <A HREF="FAQ.html#toc13.6">How do I configure Squid to receive and respond to Multicast ICP?</A>
</H2>

<P>You must tell Squid to join a multicast group address with the
<EM>mcast_groups</EM> directive.  For example:
<PRE>
        mcast_groups  224.9.9.9
</PRE>

Of course, all members of your Multicast ICP group will need to use the
exact same multicast group address.</P>

<P><B>NOTE:</B> Choose a multicast group address with care!  If two organizations
happen to choose the same multicast address, then they may find that their
groups ``overlap'' at some point.  This will be especially true if one of the
querying caches uses a large TTL value.  There are two ways to reduce the risk
of group overlap:
<OL>
<LI>Use a unique group address</LI>
<LI>Limit the scope of multicast messages with TTLs or administrative scoping.</LI>
</OL>
</P>

<P>Using a unique address is a good idea, but not without some potential
problems.  If you choose an address randomly, how do you know that
someone else will not also randomly choose the same address?  NLANR
has been assigned a block of multicast addresses by the IANA for use
in situations such as this.  If you would like to be assigned one
of these addresses, please 
<A HREF="mailto:nlanr-cache@nlanr.net">write to us</A>.  However, note that NLANR or IANA have no
authority to prevent anyone from using an address assigned to you.</P>

<P>Limiting the scope of your multicast messages is probably a better
solution.  They can be limited with the TTL value discussed above, or
with some newer techniques known as administratively scoped
addresses.  Here you can configure well-defined boundaries for the
traffic to a specific address.  The
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.isi.edu/in-notes/rfc2365.txt">Administratively Scoped IP Multicast RFC</A>
describes this.</P>
