normal for Debian
-----------------

This extension has been repackaged for lucid.  The new format (3.0 quilt)
is not available in previous Unbuntu distributions, and our repo and svn
management has changed as well since this was first packaged.  The debian
directory that one retrieves when checking out the extension from svn is
deprecated; please see instead
