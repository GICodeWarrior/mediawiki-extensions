Description: Development files for Node.js
 Node.js provides an event-based server-side javascript engine.
 .
 It is similar in design to and influenced by systems like
 Ruby's Event Machine or Python's Twisted.
 .
 Node.js takes the event model a bit further - it presents the event
 loop as a language construct instead of as a library.
 .
 This package is needed to build plugins.

 Node.js is bundled with several useful libraries to handle server tasks :
 System, Events, Standard I/O, Modules, Timers, Child Processes, POSIX,
 HTTP, Multipart Parsing, TCP, DNS, Assert, Path, URL, Query Strings.
