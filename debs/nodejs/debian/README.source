*.orig files in pristine tarball
--------------------------------

Upstream tarball sometimes contains *.orig files that are left over by
upstream patches. Since dh_clean will remove them, they are protected
by using DEB_CLEAN_EXCLUDE in debian/rules.

debian/control.in
-----------------

debian/control is generated from debian/control.in, to update it, run :
DEB_MAINTAINER_MODE=1 fakeroot debian/rules clean
