viewvc (0.9.4+svn20060318-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * With the default configuration, viewvc itself serves all the documents and
    images under docroot (the path is /etc/viewvc/templates/docroot, which is a
    link pointing to /usr/share/viewvc).  This is suboptimal, as you have a slight
    performance hit, but it allows to ship viewvc working out-of-the-box.
    Please refer to README.Debian for further information.
  * svn_parent_path has been removed in favour of a wider 'root_parents'
    parameter, valid for either CVS or Subversion.
