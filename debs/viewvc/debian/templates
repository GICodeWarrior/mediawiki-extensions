Template: viewvc/cvsroots
Type: string
Default: cvs: /var/lib/cvs
_Description: CVS roots:
 This setting specifies each of the CVS roots (repositories) on your system and assigns
 names to them.  Each root should be given by a "name: path" value.  Multiple
 roots should be separated by commas.

Template: viewvc/svnroots
Type: string
Default: svn: /var/lib/svn
_Description: SVN roots:
 This setting specifies each of the Subversion roots (repositories)
 on your system and assigns names to them.  Each root should be given

Template: viewvc/address
Type: string
_Default: <a href="mailto:admin@foo">Repository Admin</a>
_Description: Repository administrator address:
 This address is shown in the footer of the generated pages.  It must be the
 address of the local repository maintainer (e.g. <a
 href="mailto:foo@bar">cvsadmin</a>).

Template: viewvc/forbidden
Type: string
_Description: List of access-forbidden modules:
 This should contain a list of modules in the repository that should not be
 displayed (by default or by explicit path specification).  This
 configuration can be a simple list of modules, or it can get quite
 complex:
   *) The "!" can be used before a module to explicitly state that it is
 NOT forbidden.
   *) Shell-style "glob" expressions may be used. "*" will match any
 sequence of zero or more characters, "?" will match any single character,
 "[seq]" will match any character in seq, and "[!seq]" will match any
 character not in seq.

Template: viewvc/allow_tar
Type: boolean
Default: false
_Description: Allow automatic tarball generation?
 ViewVC can generate a tarball (.tar.gz) from a repository on the fly.  This
 option allows (you/anyone) to download a tarball of the current directory.
