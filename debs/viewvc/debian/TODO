Remaining things to do
----------------------
- Make a link to create /usr/bin/viewvc-make-database linking to
  /usr/lib/viewvc/make-database.
- Think about packaging mod_python module (remove -X/mod_python/
  from dh_install).
- Maybe add current SVN snapshot to lib/viewvc.py __version__ field.
- Add several other useful parameters to the debconf configuration, as
  root_parents or use_enscript/use_cvsgraph.
- Will be necessary to depend on mime-support and configure viewvc with
  /etc/mime.types as default MIME file?
