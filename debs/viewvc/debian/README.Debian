viewvc for Debian
-----------------

  ViewVC is a CGI script in Python that is accessible through
  
http://your_hostname/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi

  Basic configuration can be obtained running 'dpkg-reconfigure viewvc' as root.

  It is worth noting that viewvc does not touch anything of your web server
configuration, so you will have to add CGI support and whatever other config
options you need.  For example, if, under Apache2, accessing to the above URL
shows some Python code instead of the ViewVC pages, you could need to make the
following link:

/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/cgi.load -> /etc/apache2/mods-available/cgi.load

in order to activate CGI processing.

  You will find the ViewVC online help at the bottom of each page.


  Since viewvc 0.9.4+svn20060318-1, with the default configuration viewvc itself
serves all the help documents, images and style sheets under *docroot* (the path is
/etc/viewvc/templates/docroot, which is a link pointing to /usr/share/viewvc).  This
is suboptimal, as you have a slight performance hit, but it allows to ship viewvc
working out-of-the-box, without the pain of dealing with various web server config
files.

  If you want to avoid this in order to, for example, cache viewvc images, you will
need to uncomment 'docroot' directive in /etc/viewvc/viewvc.conf, give it a value,
and make whatever changes and alias to your webserver configuration you need in order
to expose /usr/share/viewvc as the value of 'docroot'.  In this moment, every content
previously served as:

http://localhost/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/*docroot*/images/logo.png

becomes:

http://localhost/$DOCROOT/images/logo.png

being $DOCROOT the value of the directive.
