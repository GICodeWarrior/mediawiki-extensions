'''Douglas Noël Adams''' ([[11 March]] [[1952]] &ndash; [[11 May]], [[2001]]) was an English author, comic [[radio drama]]tist, and musician. He is best known as author of the ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' series. ''Hitchhiker's'' began on radio, and developed into a "trilogy" of five books (which sold more than fifteen million copies during his lifetime) as well as a [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)|television series]], a towel, a comic book series, a [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (computer game)|computer game]] and a [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|feature film]] that was completed after Adams's death. The series has also been adapted for live theatre using various scripts; the earliest such productions used material newly written by Adams.<ref>{{cite book | author=Simpson, M. J. | title=The Pocket Essential Hitchhiker's Guide | pages = Page 52 | edition =Second edition | publisher=Pocket Essentials | year=2005 | id=ISBN 1-904048-46-3}}</ref> He was known to some fans as ''Bop Ad'' (after his illegible signature), or by his initials "[[DNA (disambiguation)|DNA]]".<ref>[http://groups.google.com/group/alt.fan.douglas-adams/browse_thread/thread/2b45dff04b442b68/0fe671d25b3b00ff?lnk=st&q=%22Bop+Ad%22&rnum=6#0fe671d25b3b00ff FAQ posted to alt.fan.douglas-adams]</ref>

In addition to ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'', Douglas Adams wrote or co-wrote three stories of the science fiction television series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', and served as Script Editor during the seventeenth season. His other written works include the ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency|Dirk Gently]]'' novels, and co-author credits on two ''[[The Meaning of Liff|Liff]]'' books and ''[[Last Chance to See]]'', itself based on a radio series. Adams also originated the idea for the computer game ''[[Starship Titanic]]'', which was realized by a company that Adams co-founded, and adapted into a novel by [[Terry Jones]]. A posthumous collection of essays and other material, including an incomplete novel, was published as ''[[The Salmon of Doubt]]'' in 2002. 

His fans and friends also knew Adams as an environmental activist, a self-described "radical [[atheist]]", and a lover of fast cars, cameras, the [[Macintosh]] computer, and other "techno gizmos." He was a keen [[technologist]], using such inventions as e-mail and [[Usenet]] before they became widely popular, or even widely known.

Toward the end of his life, he was a sought-after lecturer on topics including technology and the environment.  Since his death at the age of 49, he is still widely revered in science fiction and fantasy [[fandom]] circles.

==Early life==
<!-- Please leave this section heading as is, for the chronology of events. Adams's own family (wife and daughter) are discussed later. -->
			
Douglas Adams was born to Janet Adams ([[née]] Donovan, and now known as Janet Thrift) and Christopher Douglas Adams in [[Cambridge]], [[England]]. His parents had one other child together, Susan, who was born in March 1955. His parents separated and divorced in 1957, and Douglas, Susan, and Janet moved in with Janet's parents, the Donovans, in [[Brentwood, Essex]]. Douglas's grandmother kept her house as an official [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|RSPCA]] refuge for hurt animals, which "exacerbated young Douglas's hayfever and asthma."<ref>{{cite book | authorlink = Nick Webb (author) | last = Webb | first = Nick | title=Wish You Were Here: The Official Biography of Douglas Adams | edition =First U.S. hardcover edition | publisher=Ballantine Books | year=2005 | pages = Page 32 | id=ISBN 0-345-47650-6 }}</ref>

Christopher Adams remarried in July 1960, to Mary Judith Stewart (born Judith Robertson). From this marriage, Douglas Adams had a half-sister, Heather. Janet remarried in 1964, to a veterinarian, Ron Thrift, providing two more half-siblings to Douglas; Jane and James Thrift.

==Education and early works==
[[Image:Douglas Adams Sign from HH cover.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Douglas Adams was known to some fans as ''Bop Ad'' - after his illegible signature]]Adams first attended Primrose Hill Primary School in Brentwood. He took the exams and interviewed for [[Brentwood School (England)|Brentwood School]] at age six, and attended the Preparatory School from 1959 to 1964, then the main school until 1970. He was in the top stream, and specialised in the arts in the sixth form, after which he stayed an extra term in a special seventh form class, customary in the school for those preparing for Oxbridge entrance  exams. 

While at the Preparatory school, he had an English class, taught by Frank Halford, where Halford awarded Adams the only ten out of ten of his entire teaching career for a creative writing exercise. Adams remembered this for the rest of his life, especially when facing writer's block. Some of Adams's earliest writing was published at the school, such as a report on the school's Photography Club in ''The Brentwoodian'' (in 1962) or spoof reviews in the school magazine ''Broadsheet'' (edited by [[Paul Neil Milne Johnstone]]). Adams also had a letter and short story published nationally in the UK in the boys' magazine ''The Eagle'' in 1965. He met [[Griff Rhys Jones]], who was in the year below, at the school, and was in the same class as "Stuckist" artist [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]]; all three appeared together in a production of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar in 1968. He was six feet tall (1.83 m) by the time he was 12, and he stopped growing only at 6'5" (1.96 m). Later, he would often make self-ironic jokes about his own towering stature, "...the form-master wouldn't say 'Meet under the clock tower,' or 'Meet under the War Memorial,' but 'Meet under Adams.'"<ref>{{cite book | author=Adams, Douglas | title=The Salmon of Doubt: Hitchhiking the Galaxy One Last Time | edition=First UK hardcover edition | publisher=Macmillan | year=2002 | pages=Page 7 | id=ISBN 0-333-76657-1}}</ref>

On the strength of a bravura essay on religious poetry that mixed the [[Beatles]] with [[William Blake]], he was awarded a place at [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] to read English, entering in 1971.<ref>Webb, Nick, ‘Adams, Douglas Noël (1952–2001)’, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', online edn, Oxford University Press, January 2005 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/75853, accessed [[25 October]] [[2005]]]</ref> Adams attempted early on to get into the [[Footlights]] Dramatic Club, with which several other names in British Comedy had been affiliated. He was, however, turned down, and started to write and perform in revues with Will Adams (no relation) and [[Martin Smith]], forming a group called "Adams-Smith-Adams." Later, on another attempt to join Footlights, Adams was encouraged by [[Simon Jones (actor)|Simon Jones]] and found himself working with Rhys Jones, among others. In 1974, Adams graduated with a B.A. in [[English literature]].

Some of his early work appeared on [[BBC2]] (television) in 1974, in an edited version of the ''Footlights Revue'' from Cambridge, that year. A version of the same revue performed live in London's [[West End of London|West End]] led to Adams being "discovered" by [[Monty Python]]'s [[Graham Chapman]]. The two formed a brief writing partnership, and Adams earned a writing credit in one episode (episode 45: "Party Political Broadcast on Behalf of the Liberal Party") of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' for a sketch called "[[Patient Abuse]]." In the sketch, a man who had been stabbed by a nurse arrives at his doctor's office bleeding profusely from the stomach, when the doctor makes him fill out numerous senseless forms before he can administer treatment (a joke he later incorporated into the [[Races and Species in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Vogons|Vogons]]' obsession with paperwork). Adams also contributed to a sketch on the album for ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]''.

[[Image:DNA in Monty Python.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Douglas Adams in his first ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus|Monty Python]]'' appearance, in full surgeon's garb in episode 42.]]

Douglas also had two "blink and you miss them" appearances in the fourth series of ''Monty Python's Flying Circus''. At the beginning of Episode 42, "The Light Entertainment War," Adams is in a surgeon's mask (as Dr. Emile Koning, according to the on-screen captions), pulling on gloves, while [[Michael Palin]] narrates a sketch that introduces one person after another, and never actually gets started. At the beginning of Episode 44, "Mr Neutron," Adams is dressed in a "[[Pepperpot (Monty Python)|pepperpot]]" outfit and loads a missile onto a cart, driven by [[Terry Jones]], who is calling out for scrap metal ("Any old iron..."). The two episodes were first broadcast in November 1974. Adams and Chapman also attempted a few non-Python projects, including ''[[Out of the Trees]].''

Some of Adams's early radio work included sketches for ''[[The Burkiss Way]]'' in 1977 and ''[[The News Huddlines]]''. He also co-wrote, again with Graham Chapman, the [[20 February]] [[1977]] episode of ''Doctor on the Go'', a sequel to the ''[[Doctor in the House (TV series)|Doctor in the House]]'' television comedy series.

As Adams had difficulty selling his jokes and stories, he took a series of "odd jobs" in order to have some income. A biography from an early edition of one of the ''HHGG'' novels provides the following description of his early career:
:After graduation he spent several years contributing material to radio and television shows as well as writing, performing, and sometimes directing [[revue|stage revues]] in [[London]], Cambridge and at the [[Edinburgh Fringe]]. He has also worked at various times as a hospital porter, barn builder, chicken shed cleaner, bodyguard, [[radio producer]] and [[script editor]] of ''[[Doctor Who]]''.
Adams held the job as a bodyguard in the mid-1970s. He was employed by an Arab family, which had made its fortune in oil (and were from [[Qatar]], according to the ''Encyclopedia Britannica'').<ref>"Adams, Douglas Noël." Britannica Book of the Year, 2002 from Encyclopædia Britannica Online School Edition. [http://school.eb.com/eb/article-9383539, accessed [[November 13]] [[2005]]].</ref> He had a couple of favourite anecdotes about the job: one story related that the family once ordered one of everything from a hotel's menu, tried all of the dishes, and sent out for hamburgers. Another story had to do with a prostitute, sent to the floor Adams was guarding one evening. They acknowledged each other as she entered, and an hour later, when she left, she is said to have remarked, "At least you can read while you're on the job."<ref>Webb, page 93.</ref>

[[Image:Remarkable Fidgety River Title.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Title card from the ''[[Doctor Snuggles]]'' episode "The Remarkable Fidgety River", written by Douglas Adams and [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]].]]

In 1979, Adams and [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]] wrote the scripts for two half-hour episodes of ''[[Doctor Snuggles]]'': "The Remarkable Fidgety River" and "The Great Disappearing Mystery" (episodes seven and twelve). John Lloyd was also co-author of two episodes from the original "Hitchhiker" radio series (Fit the Fifth and Fit the Sixth (also known as Episodes Five and Six, ''see explanation below'')), as well as ''[[The Meaning of Liff]]'' and ''[[The Deeper Meaning of Liff]]''. Lloyd and Adams also collaborated on an SF movie comedy project based on ''[[The Guinness Book of World Records]]'', which would have starred [[John Cleese]] as the UN Secretary General, and had a race of aliens beating humans in athletic competitions, but the humans winning in all of the "absurd" record categories. This latter project never proceeded past a treatment.

After the first radio series of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide'' became successful, Adams was made a BBC radio producer, working on ''[[Week Ending]]'' and a [[pantomime]] called ''[[Black Cinderella Two Goes East]]''. He left the position after six months to become the script editor for [[Doctor Who]].

==''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy''==
{{main|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy}}
''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' was a concept for a science-fiction comedy radio series pitched by Adams and radio producer [[Simon Brett]] to [[BBC Radio 4]] in 1977. Adams came up with an outline for a pilot episode, as well as a few other stories (reprinted in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s book ''[[Don't Panic: The Official Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Companion]]'') that could potentially be used in the series. 

According to Adams, the idea for the title ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' occurred to him while he lay drunk in a field in [[Innsbruck, Austria]] (though he joked that the [[BBC]] would instead claim it was Spain "probably because it's easier to spell"<ref>{{cite book | author=Adams, Douglas| editor= Geoffrey Perkins (ed.),  Additional Material by M. J. Simpson|title=[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: The Original Radio Scripts]] | pages = Page 10 | edition =25th Anniversary Edition | publisher=Pan Books | year=2003 | id=ISBN 0-330-41957-9}} [http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/hitchhikers/metaguide/beginning.shtml One of the webpages] about ''Hitchhiker's'' on bbc.co.uk states "The BBC used to say this happened in Spain, but we know how to spell Innsbruck now."</ref>), gazing at the stars. He had been wandering the countryside while carrying a book called the ''[[Hitch-hiker's Guide to Europe]]'' when he ran into a town where, as he humorously describes, everyone was either "deaf" and "dumb" or only spoke languages he could not. After wandering around and drinking for a while, he went to sleep in the middle of a field and was inspired by his inability to communicate with the townspeople. He later said that due to his constantly retelling this story of inspiration, he no longer had any memory of the moment of inspiration itself, and only remembered his retellings of that moment. A postscript to M. J. Simpson's biography of Adams, ''Hitchhiker'', provides evidence that the story was in fact a fabrication and that Adams had conceived the idea some time ''after'' his trip around Europe.

Despite the original outline, Adams was said to make up the stories as he wrote. He turned to [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]] for help with the final two episodes of [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#The Primary Phase|the first series]]. Lloyd contributed bits from an unpublished science fiction book of his own, called ''GiGax''.<ref>Webb, page 120.</ref> However, very little of Lloyd's material survived in later adaptations of ''Hitchhiker's'', such as the novels and the TV series. The TV series itself was based on the first six radio episodes, but sections contributed by Lloyd were largely re-written. 

[[BBC Radio 4]] broadcast the first radio series weekly in the UK in March and April 1978. Following the success of the first series, another episode was recorded and broadcast, which was commonly known as the Christmas Episode. [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#The Secondary Phase|A second series]] of five episodes was broadcast one per night, during the week of [[21 January]] - [[25 January]] [[1980]]. 

While working on the radio series (and with simultaneous projects such as ''[[The Pirate Planet]]'') Adams developed problems keeping to writing deadlines that only got worse as he published novels. Adams was never a prolific writer and usually had to be forced by others to do any writing. This included being locked in a hotel suite with his editor for three weeks to ensure that ''[[So Long, and Thanks For All the Fish]]'' was completed.<ref>[http://www.bookslut.com/nonfiction/2004_05_002057.php May 2004 review of] ''[[Don't Panic: The Official Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Companion|Don't Panic]]'' by [[Neil Gaiman]].</ref> He was quoted as saying, "I love deadlines. I love the whooshing noise they make as they go by."<ref>{{cite book | author=Simpson, M. J. | title=Hitchhiker: A Biography of Douglas Adams | pages = Page 236 | edition =First U.S. hardcover edition | publisher=Justin, Charles and Co. | year=2003 | id=ISBN 1-932112-17-0}}</ref> Despite the difficulty with deadlines, Adams eventually authored five novels in the series, published in 1979, 1980, 1982, 1984 and 1992.

[[Image:DNA with H2G2 towel.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Douglas Adams with an officially licensed ''Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' towel on his left shoulder.]]

The books formed the basis for other adaptations, such as three-part comic book adaptations for each of the first three books, an interactive text-adventure [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (computer game)|computer game]], and a photo-illustrated edition, published in 1994. This latter edition featured a [[42 Puzzle]] designed by Adams, which was later incorporated into paperback covers of the first four "Hitchhiker's" novels (the paperback for the fifth re-used the artwork from the hardcover edition).<ref>[http://www.iblist.com/series.php?id=2 Internet Book List] page, with links to all five novels, and reproductions of the 1990s paperback covers that included the [[42 Puzzle]].</ref> 

In 1980, Adams also began attempts to turn the first ''Hitchhiker's'' novel into a movie, making several trips to [[Los Angeles, California]], and working with a number of Hollywood studios and potential producers. The next year, 1981, the radio series became the basis for a BBC television mini-series [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081874/ "The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy"] broadcast in six parts. When he died in 2001 in California, he had been trying again to get the movie project started with Disney, which had bought the rights in 1998. The screenplay finally got a posthumous re-write by [[Karey Kirkpatrick]], was green-lit in September 2003, and [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|the resulting movie]] was released in 2005.

Radio Producer [[Dirk Maggs]] had consulted with Adams, first in 1993, and later in 1997 and 2000 about creating a third radio series, based on the third novel in the ''Hitchhiker's'' series.<ref>{{cite book | author=Adams, Douglas. | editor = [[Dirk Maggs]], dramatizations and editor. | title=The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Radio Scripts: The Tertiary, Quandary and Quintessential Phases | publisher=Pan Books | year=2005|id=ISBN 0-330-43510-8 |pages=Page xiv}}</ref> They also vaguely discussed the possibilities of radio adaptations of the final two novels in the five-book "trilogy." As with the movie, this project was only realized after Adams's death. The third series, ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Tertiary Phase|The Tertiary Phase]]'', was broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] in September 2004 and was subsequently released on audio CD. With the aid of a recording of his reading of ''Life, the Universe and Everything'' and editing, Douglas Adams himself can be heard playing the part of Agrajag posthumously. ''So Long, and Thanks For All the Fish'' and ''Mostly Harmless'' made up the fourth and fifth radio series, respectively (on radio they were titled ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Quandary Phase|The Quandary Phase]]'' and ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Quintessential Phase|The Quintessential Phase]]'') and these were broadcast in May and June of 2005, and also subsequently released on Audio CD. The last episode in the last series (with a new, "more upbeat" ending) concluded with, "The very final episode of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' by Douglas Adams is affectionately dedicated to its author."<ref>Ibid. Page 356</ref>

More recently, the film makers at Smoov Filmz adapted the anecdote that [[Arthur Dent]] relates about biscuits in ''[[So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish]]'' into a short film called "Cookies."<ref>[http://www.smoovfilmz.com/ Smoov Filmz] homepage. "Cookies" is featured under "Filmz and Projects."</ref> Adams also discussed the real-life episode that inspired the anecdote in a 2001 speech, reprinted in his posthumous collection ''[[The Salmon of Doubt]]''.  He also told the story on the radio programme ''It Makes Me Laugh'' on [[19 July]] [[1981]].

==''Doctor Who''==
{{main|Doctor Who}}
[[Image:The Pirate Planet Writers Credit.jpg|thumb|200px|Douglas Adams's credit from the opening titles of the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial ''[[The Pirate Planet]]''.]]
Adams sent the script for the HHGG pilot radio programme to the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' production office in 1978, and was commissioned to write ''[[The Pirate Planet]]'' (see below). He had also previously attempted to submit a potential movie script, called "Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen," which later became his novel ''Life, the Universe and Everything'' (which in turn became the third ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' radio series). Adams then went on to serve as script editor on the show for its seventeenth season in 1979. Altogether, he wrote three [[List of Doctor Who serials|''Doctor Who'' serials]] starring [[Tom Baker]] as the Doctor:

* ''The Pirate Planet'' (the second serial in the "[[The Key to Time|Key To Time]]" arc, in [[List of Doctor Who serials#Season 16 (1978-79)|Season 16]])
* ''[[City of Death]]'' (with producer [[Graham Williams]], from an original storyline by writer [[David Fisher (writer)|David Fisher]]. It was transmitted under the pseudonym "[[David Agnew]]")
* ''[[Shada]]'' (only partially filmed and not broadcast due to industrial disputes)

The episodes authored by Adams are some of the few that have not been novelized as Adams would not allow anyone else to novelize them, and asked for a higher price than the publishers were willing to pay.<ref>[http://www.skepticfiles.org/en001/drwhogde.htm A 1990s Doctor Who FAQ]</ref>

Adams was also known to allow [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy cultural references#Hitchhiker's references in Doctor Who|in-jokes]] from ''The Hitchhiker's Guide'' to appear in the ''Doctor Who'' stories he wrote and other stories on which he served as Script Editor. Subsequent writers have also inserted ''Hitchhiker's'' references, even [[42 (Doctor Who)|as recently as 2007]].  Conversely, at least one reference to ''Doctor Who'' was worked into a ''Hitchhiker's'' novel. In ''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]'', two characters travel in time and land on the pitch at [[Lord's Cricket Ground]]. The reaction of the radio commentators to their sudden appearance is very similar to the reactions of commentators in a scene in the eighth episode of the 1965-66 story ''[[The Daleks' Master Plan]]'', which has [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]'s [[TARDIS]] [[Materialization (science fiction)|materialise]] on the pitch at Lord's.  

Elements of ''Shada'' and ''City of Death'' were reused in Adams's later novel ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]'', in particular the character of [[Professor Chronotis]], and Dirk Gently himself clearly fills much the same plot role as the Doctor (though the character is very different). [[Big Finish Productions]] eventually remade ''Shada'' as an audio play starring [[Paul McGann]] as the Doctor. Accompanied by partially animated illustrations, it was [[Doctor Who spin-offs#Webcasts|webcast]] on the [[BBCi]] website in 2003, and subsequently released as a two-CD set later that year. An omnibus edition of this version was broadcast on the digital radio station [[BBC7]] on [[10 December]] [[2005]].

Adams is credited with introducing a fan and later friend of his, the zoologist [[Richard Dawkins]], to Dawkins' future wife, [[Lalla Ward]], who had played the part of [[Romana]] in Doctor Who. Dawkins confirmed this in his published eulogy of Adams.<ref>http://www.edge.org/documents/adams_index.html</ref>

When he was at school, he wrote and performed a play called ''Doctor Which''.<ref>{{cite book | author=Adams, Douglas | title=The Salmon of Doubt: Hitchhiking the Galaxy One Last Time | edition=First UK hardcover edition | publisher=Macmillan | year=2002 | pages=Page xviii | id=ISBN 0-333-76657-1}}</ref>

==Music==
Adams played the [[guitar]] left-handed and had a collection of twenty-four left-handed guitars when he died in 2001 (having received his first guitar in 1964). He also studied [[piano]] in the 1960s with the same teacher as [[Paul Wickens]], the pianist who later played in [[Paul McCartney]]'s band (and composed the music for the 2004-2005 editions of the ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' radio series).<ref>Webb, page 49.</ref> [[The Beatles]], [[Pink Floyd]] and [[Procol Harum]] all had great influence on Adams's work.

===Pink Floyd===
Adams included a direct reference to [[Pink Floyd]] in the original radio version of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', in which he describes the main characters surveying the landscape of an alien planet while Marvin, their android companion, hums Pink Floyd's "[[Shine on You Crazy Diamond]]". See also [[Pink Floyd trivia]].

Adams's official biography shares its name with the song "[[Wish You Were Here (1975 song)|Wish You Were Here]]" by [[Pink Floyd]]. Adams was friends with Pink Floyd guitarist [[David Gilmour]] and, on the occasion of Adams' 42nd birthday (the number 42 having especial significance, being [[The Answer to Life, the Universe and Everything]] and also Adams' age when his daughter Polly was born), he was invited to make a guest appearance at Pink Floyd's [[28 October]] [[1994]] concert at Earls Court in [[London]], playing [[rhythm guitar]] on the songs "[[Brain Damage (song)|Brain Damage]]" and "[[Eclipse (song)|Eclipse]]". Adams chose the name for Pink Floyd's 1994 album, ''[[The Division Bell]]'' by picking the words from the lyrics to one of its tracks, namely "High Hopes". Gilmour also performed at Adams's memorial service following his death in 2001.

Pink Floyd and their lavish stage shows were also the inspiration for the Adams-created fictional [[rock band]] "[[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Hotblack Desiato|Disaster Area]]", described in the ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' as not only the loudest rock band in the galaxy, but in fact the loudest noise of any kind at all. One element of Disaster Area's stage show was to send a space ship hurtling into a sun, probably inspired by the plane that would crash into the stage during some of Pink Floyd's live shows, usually at the end of "[[On the Run (Pink Floyd song)|On the Run]]". The 1968 Pink Floyd song "[[Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun]]" may also have influenced part of the ideas behind Disaster Area.

===Procol Harum===
Douglas Adams was a good friend of [[Gary Brooker]], the lead singer, pianist and songwriter of the [[progressive rock]] band [[Procol Harum]]. Adams is known to have invited Brooker to one of the many parties that Adams held at his house. On one such occasion Gary Brooker performed the full (4 verse) version of his hit song "[[A Whiter Shade of Pale]]". Brooker also performed at Adams's Memorial Service.

Adams also appeared on stage with Brooker to perform "In Held Twas in I" at Redhill when the band's lyricist [[Keith Reid]] was not available. On several other occasions he had been known to introduce Procol Harum at their gigs. 

Adams also let it be known that while writing he would listen to music, and this would occasionally influence his work. On one occasion the title track from the Procol Harum album ''[[Grand Hotel (album)|Grand Hotel]]'' was playing when...
{{quote|Suddenly in the middle of the song there was this huge orchestral climax that came out of nowhere and didn't seem to be about anything. I kept wondering what was this huge thing happening in the background? And I eventually thought ... it sounds as if there ought to be some sort of floorshow going on. Something huge and extraordinary, like, well, like the end of the universe. And so that was where the idea for The Restaurant at the End of the Universe came from.|Douglas Adams|Procol Harum at The Barbican<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.procolharum.com/dadams.htm |title=Text of one of Douglas Adams's introductions of Procol Harum in concert |accessmonthday=August 21 | accessyear=2006|last=Adams |first=Douglas |date=[[8 February]] [[1996]]}}</ref>}}

===Other musical links===
Adams made a number of references to music and musicians who had influenced his work through his books. In the ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' series, examples include one of the two mice, in ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (book)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', suggesting that as they have not found the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything, they should instead make it up, proposing to use the question "How many roads must a man walk down?" This is a line from [[Bob Dylan]]'s song, "[[Blowin' in the Wind]]". Prior to this scene, in the same novel, the ship's computer onboard the [[Heart of Gold (spaceship)|Heart of Gold]], unable to assist or prevent the ship's impending destruction with two nuclear missiles closing in on it, sings "[[You'll Never Walk Alone (song)|You'll Never Walk Alone]]" in the background, a [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] hit from the musical ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]'' which had been an early 1960s rock hit in the UK and then was adopted as a crowd chant by many [[football (soccer)|football]] fans, in particular [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] supporters.

''[[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe]]'', the second novel in the series, is dedicated to the 1980 Paul Simon soundtrack album, ''[[One-Trick Pony (album)|One-Trick Pony]]''. Adams says he played it "incessantly" while writing the book. In one scene in the fourth novel, ''[[So Long, and Thanks For All the Fish]]'', Arthur Dent listens to a [[Dire Straits]] LP and Adams goes on to pay tribute to their lead guitarist, [[Mark Knopfler]]. Adams later revealed that the particular song to which he refers in the book &mdash; although never by name &mdash; is "[[Tunnel of Love (song)|Tunnel of Love]]", from the ''[[Making Movies]]'' album. And in the final novel, ''[[Mostly Harmless]]'', [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] is discovered playing in a diner attended by [[Ford Prefect (character)|Ford Prefect]] and [[Arthur Dent]], where he is simply known as "The King".

Besides modern rock music, Douglas Adams was a great admirer of the work of [[JS Bach]], which provides a minor plot element in ''Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency''. Adams was also good friends with [[The Monkees]]' [[Michael Nesmith]]. In the early 1990s, one of the aborted attempts to have ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' adapted into a movie would have had Nesmith as its producer.

Adams was also a major fan of [[The Beatles]]. He makes a reference to [[Paul McCartney]] in ''Life, the Universe and Everything'' and quotes lyrics and titles from songs by The Beatles in ''Mostly Harmless'' and ''Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency''. Adams also does this several times in ''The Salmon of Doubt''. There is also an article on the [[Beatles]] in "The Salmon of Doubt". In Chapter 3 there is a conversation between Kate and Dirk, which includes the following exchange:

:"So?"<br>
:"I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair."

Taken together, these two lines form a quotation from "[[Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)|Norwegian Wood]]" on the ''[[Rubber Soul]]'' album.

==Computer games and projects==
[[Image:MeretzkyAndAdams.jpg|left|thumb|Douglas Adams and Steve Meretzky, 1984]]Douglas Adams created an [[interactive fiction]] version of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (computer game)|HHGG]]'' together with [[Steve Meretzky]] from [[Infocom]] in 1984. In 1986 he participated in a weeklong brainstorming session with the [[Lucasfilm Games]] team for the game ''[[Labyrinth (game)|Labyrinth]]''. Later he was also involved in creating ''[[Bureaucracy (computer game)|Bureaucracy]]'' (also by Infocom, but not based on any book). Adams was also responsible for the computer game ''[[Starship Titanic]]'', which was published in 1999 by [[Simon and Schuster]]. Terry Jones wrote the accompanying book, entitled ''Douglas Adams’s Starship Titanic'', since Adams was too busy with the computer game to do both. In April 1999, Adams initiated the [[H2G2|h2g2]] [[collaborative writing]] project, an experimental attempt at making ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' a reality.

In 1990, Adams wrote and presented a [[television documentary]] programme ''[[Hyperland]]''<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0188677/ Internet Movie Database's page for ''Hyperland''].</ref> which featured [[Tom Baker]] as a "software agent" (similar to the "Assistants" used in several versions of [[Microsoft Office]], derived from their failed "Bob" program), and interviews with [[Ted Nelson]], which was essentially about the use of [[hypertext]]. Although Adams did not ''invent'' hypertext, he was an [[early adopter]] and advocate of it. This was the same year that [[Tim Berners-Lee]] used the idea of hypertext in his [[HTML]].

==The ''Dirk Gently'' series==
[[Image:Dirk Gently UK front cover.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Front cover of the original UK hardcover edition of ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]''.]]

In between Adams's first trip to Madagascar with [[Mark Carwardine]] in 1985, and their series of travels that formed the basis for the radio series and non-fiction book ''[[Last Chance to See]]'', Adams wrote two other novels with a new cast of characters. ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]'' was first published in 1987, and was described by its author as "a kind of ghost-horror-detective-time-travel-romantic-comedy-epic, mainly concerned with mud, music and quantum mechanics."<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Neil Gaiman|Gaiman, Neil]] | title=Don't Panic: Douglas Adams & The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy | edition=Second U.S. edition | publisher=Titan Books | year=2003 | pages=Page 169 | id=ISBN 1-84023-742-2}}</ref> It received many rave reviews from American newspapers upon its publication in the USA. Adams borrowed a few ideas from two ''[[Doctor Who]]'' stories he had worked on: ''[[City of Death]]'' and ''[[Shada]]''. 

A sequel novel, ''[[The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul]]'' was published a year later. This was an entirely original work, Adams's first since ''So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish.'' Reviewers, however, were not as generous with praise for the second volume as they had been for the first. After the obligatory book tours, Adams was off on his round-the-world excursion which supplied him with the material for ''Last Chance to See''.

==Personal beliefs==
===Religion===
Adams was a self-declared "radical [[atheist]]", though he used the term for emphasis, so that he would not be asked if he in fact meant [[agnostic]]. He stated in an interview with [[American Atheists]]<ref>[http://www.americanatheist.org/win98-99/T2/silverman.html David Silverman's interview with Douglas Adams] which first appeared in the American Atheists' Winter 1998-1999 newsletter.</ref> that this made things easier, but most importantly that it conveyed the fact that he really meant it, had thought about it a great deal, and that it was an opinion he held seriously. He was convinced that there is no [[God]], having never seen one shred of [[evidence]] to convince him otherwise, and devoted himself instead to secular causes such as [[environmentalism]]. Despite this, he did state in the same interview that he was "fascinated by religion." [...] "I love to keep poking and prodding at it. I’ve thought about it so much over the years that that fascination is bound to spill over into my writing." His fascination he ascribed to the fact that so many "otherwise rational... intelligent people... nevertheless take it [the existence of God] seriously".

The evolutionary biologist and atheist [[Richard Dawkins]] claims, on page 117 of his book ''[[The God Delusion]]'' that  Adams is "possibly [my] only convert" to atheism. In the same paragraph Dawkins affectionately expresses the missing of his close friend.<ref>[http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/roundupstory/0,,1939704,00.html Observer, ''The God Delusion'', 5 November 2006]</ref>  Dawkins's book is dedicated to Adams's memory.

====Sentient Puddle====

One analogy that Adams put forward on the subject of religion was that of the "sentient [[puddle]]". This analogy is intended to refute the suggestion that the existence of God and His love for mankind would be proven by the fact that the world is perfectly designed for our needs. He compared such thinkers to an intelligent puddle of water. He said the puddle is pleased with itself and certain that the hole in the ground it occupies must have been designed specifically for it since it fits so well in it. The puddle looks up to the sun above and worships its divine benefactor. The fate of the puddle is to exist under the sun until it has entirely evaporated.<ref>{{cite book | author=Adams, Douglas | others=Edited by Peter Guzzardi | title=The Salmon of Doubt: Hitchhiking the Galaxy One Last Time | edition =First UK hardcover edition | publisher=Macmillan | year=2002 | pages = Pages 131-2|id=ISBN 0-333-76657-1 }} The full text is reproduced in the essay "Is there an Artificial God?"</ref><ref>"[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,490295,00.html Lament for Douglas Adams]" by [[Richard Dawkins]], which refers to the same allegory. First published on [[14 May]] [[2001]], accessed on [[13 July]] [[2006]].</ref>

===Environmental activism===
Adams was also an [[environmental activist]] who campaigned on behalf of a number of [[endangered species]]. This activism included the production of the non-fiction radio series ''[[Last Chance to See]]'', in which he and [[natural history|naturalist]] [[Mark Carwardine]] visited rare species such as the [[Kakapo]], and the publication of a tie-in book of the same name. In 1992, this was made into a CD-ROM combination of [[audio book]], [[e-book]] and picture slide show years before such things became fashionable. 

Adams and Mark Carwardine contributed the 'Meeting a Gorilla' passage from ''[[Last Chance to See]]'' to the book ''[[Great Ape Project|The Great Ape Project]]''.<ref>{{cite book | author=[[Paola Cavalieri|Cavalieri, Paola]] and [[Peter Singer]], editors | title=The Great Ape Project: Equality Beyond Humanity | edition=U.S. Paperback | publisher=St. Martin's Griffin | year=1994 | pages=pages 19-23|id=ISBN 0-312-11818-X}}</ref> This book, edited by [[Paola Cavalieri]] and [[Peter Singer]] launched a wider-scale project in 1993, which calls for the extension of moral equality to include all great apes, human or nonhuman.

In 1994 he participated in a climb of [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] while wearing a rhino suit for the British charity organization ''[[Save the Rhino]]''. Many different people participated in the same climb and took turns wearing rhino suit; Adams wore the suit while traveling to the mountain before the climb proper began. About £100,000 were raised through that event, benefiting schools in [[Kenya]] and a [[Black Rhinoceros]] preservation programme in [[Tanzania]]. Adams was also an active supporter of the ''[[Dian Fossey]] Gorilla Fund''.

Since 2003, ''[[Save the Rhino]]'' has held an annual Douglas Adams Memorial Lecture around the time of his birthday to raise money for environmental campaigns.<ref>[http://www.savetherhino.org/etargetsrinm/site/808/default.aspx Details of Fifth Douglas Adams Memorial Lecture].</ref>  The lectures in the series are:

* 2003 [[Richard Dawkins]] — ''Queerer than we can suppose: the strangeness of science''
* 2004 [[Robert Swan]] — on walking across [[Antarctica]] and his environmental work there 
* 2005 [[Mark Carwardine]] — ''Last Chance to See… Just a bit more'' 
* 2006 [[Robert Winston]] — ''Is the Human an Endangered Species?''
* 2007 [[Richard Leakey]] — ''Wildlife Management in East Africa – Is there a future?''
* 2008 [[Steven Pinker]] — ''The Stuff of Thought, Language as a Window into Human Nature''

===Technology===
Adams was a serious fan of technology. Though he did not buy his first [[word processor]] until 1982, he had considered one as early as 1979.  He was quoted as saying that until 1982, he had difficulties with "the impenetrable barrier of jargon. Words were flying backwards and forwards without concepts riding on their backs." In 1982, his first purchase was a 'Nexus'. In 1983, when he and Jane Belson went out to Los Angeles, he bought a [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] [[Rainbow 100|Rainbow]]. Upon their return to England, Adams bought an [[Apricot Computers|Apricot]], then a [[BBC Micro]] and a [[Tandy Corporation|Tandy]] 1000.<ref>Simpson, ''Hitchhiker'', pages 184-5.</ref> In ''[[Last Chance to See]]'' Adams mentions his [[Cambridge Z88]], which he had taken to [[Zaire]] on a quest to find the Northern White Rhinoceros.<ref>{{cite book|author=Adams, Douglas and [[Mark Carwardine]] | title=Last Chance to See | edition=First U.S. Hardcover | publisher=Harmony Books | year=1991 | pages=Page 59 | id=ISBN 0-517-58215-5}}</ref>

Adams's posthumously published work, ''[[The Salmon of Doubt]]'', features multiple articles written by Douglas on the subject of technology, including reprints of articles that originally ran in ''MacUser'' magazine, and in ''The Independent on Sunday'' newspaper. In these, Adams claims that one of the first computers he ever saw was a [[Commodore PET]], and that his love affair with the [[Apple Macintosh]] first began after seeing one at Infocom's headquarters in Massachusetts in 1983 (though that was actually very likely an [[Apple Lisa]]).<ref>{{cite book | author=Adams, Douglas | title=The Salmon of Doubt: Hitchhiking the Galaxy One Last Time | edition=First UK hardcover edition | publisher=Macmillan | year=2002 | pages=Pages 90-1 | id=ISBN 0-333-76657-1}}</ref>

Adams was a Macintosh user from the time they first came out in 1984 until his death in 2001.  He was the second person to buy a Mac in the UK (the first being [[Stephen Fry]] - though some accounts differ on this, saying Adams bought the first two, and Fry bought the third). Adams was also an "Apple Master," one of several celebrities whom Apple made into spokespeople for its products (other Apple Masters included [[John Cleese]] and [[Gregory Hines]]). Adams's contributions included a rock video that he created using the first version of [[iMovie]] with footage featuring his daughter Polly. The video can still be seen on Adams's [[.Mac]] homepage. Adams even installed and started using the first release of [[Mac OS X]] in the weeks leading up to his death. His very last post to his own forum was in praise of Mac OS X and the possibilities of its [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]] programming framework.<ref>[http://www.douglasadams.com/cgi-bin/mboard/info/dnathread.cgi?2922,1 Adams's final post on his forums at douglasadams.com]</ref> Adams can also be seen in the ''Omnibus'' tribute included with the Region One/NTSC DVD release of the TV adaptation of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide'' using Mac OS X (version 10.0.x) on his [[PowerBook]] G3.

Adams used e-mail extensively from the technology's infancy, adopting a very early version of e-mail to correspond with [[Steve Meretzky]] during the pair's collaboration on Infocom's version of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (computer game)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''. While living in New Mexico in 1993 he set up another e-mail address and began posting to his own [[USENET]] newsgroup, alt.fan.douglas-adams, and occasionally, when his computer was acting up, to the comp.sys.mac hierarchy.<ref>[http://groups-beta.google.com/group/alt.fan.douglas-adams alt.fan.douglas-adams] access through [[Google]]'s newsgroup reader.</ref> Many of his posts are now archived through [[Google]]. Challenges to the authenticity of his messages later led Adams to set up a message forum on his own website to avoid the issue.

==Personal life==
In the early 1980s, Adams had an affair with married novelist [[Sally Emerson]], to whom he dedicated his book ''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]''. In 1981 Emerson returned to her husband, [[Peter Stothard]], a contemporary of Adams at [[Brentwood School (England)|Brentwood School]]. Adams was soon afterward introduced by friends to Jane Belson, with whom he later became romantically involved. Belson was the "lady barrister" mentioned in the jacket-flap biography printed in his books during the mid-1980s ("He [Adams] lives in Islington with a lady barrister and an Apple Macintosh"). The two lived in Los Angeles together during 1983 while Adams worked on an early screenplay adaptation of ''Hitchhiker's''. When the deal fell through, they moved to London, and after several separations ("He is currently not certain where he lives, or with whom") and an aborted engagement, they were married on [[25 November]] [[1991]]. Adams and Belson had one daughter together, Polly Jane Rocket Adams, born on [[22 June]] [[1994]], in the year that Adams turned [[42 (number)#In pop culture|42]]. In 1999, the family moved from London to [[Santa Barbara, California]], where they lived until Adams's death. Following his funeral, Jane Belson and Polly Adams returned to London, where they currently reside.<ref>Webb, Chapter 10.</ref>

==Death==
Adams died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at the age of 49 on Friday [[11 May]], [[2001]], while working out at a private [[gym]] in [[Montecito, California]]. He suffered a narrowing of the coronary arteries which led to a [[myocardial infarction]] and a fatal [[cardiac arrhythmia]]. He was survived by his wife Jane and daughter Polly. Adams had been due to deliver the commencement address at [[Harvey Mudd College]] on [[13 May]].<ref>[http://chronicle.com/free/speakers/index.php3?handler=search&Last_Name=&Institution=&State=&year=&order=name&page=2 List of] collegiate commencement speakers in the ''Chronicle of Higher Education''</ref> His funeral was held on [[16 May]], [[2001]] in Santa Barbara, California. Several friends and people he had worked with were in attendance. His ashes were placed in [[Highgate Cemetery]] in north [[London]] that June.<ref>Simpson, ''Hitchhiker'', pages 337-8</ref> 

A memorial service was held on [[17 September]], [[2001]] at St. Martin-in-the-Fields Church, Trafalgar Square, London. This became the first church service of any kind broadcast live on the web by the BBC.<ref>Gaiman, 204</ref> Video clips of the service are still available on the BBC's website for download.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/hitchhikers/celebration/ Douglas Adams's] Service of Celebration clips on the BBC website</ref>

In May 2002, ''[[The Salmon of Doubt]]'' was published, containing many [[short story|short stories]], [[essay]]s, and letters, as well as [[eulogy|eulogies]] from [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Stephen Fry]] (in the UK edition), [[Christopher Cerf]] (in the U.S. edition), and [[Terry Jones]] (in the U.S. paperback edition). It also includes eleven chapters of his long-awaited but unfinished novel, ''The Salmon of Doubt'', which was possibly to become a new ''[[Dirk Gently]]'' novel,  ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|Hitchhiker]]'' novel or original fiction.

Other events after Adams's death included the completion of ''[[Shada]]'', radio dramatizations of the final three books in the ''Hitchhiker's'' series, and the completion of the film adaptation of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (book)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''. An eighteen part radio series based on the [[Dirk Gently]] novels was announced in 2007, with transmission scheduled for October of that year.<ref>[http://www.dirkmaggs.dswilliams.co.uk/dirk%20maggs%20news%20%20new%20projects.htm Dirk Maggs] News and New Projects page</ref>

==Biographies==
His [[official biography]], ''Wish You Were Here'', by [[Nick Webb (author)|Nick Webb]], was published on [[6 October]] [[2003]] (ISBN 0-7553-1155-8).<ref>[http://www.douglasadams.com/news/#20030703-0-n.dna Press release announcing Nick Webb's biography of Adams] from [[2 July]] [[2003]].</ref>

Another biography is ''[[Hitchhiker: a Biography of Douglas Adams (book)|Hitchhiker: a Biography of Douglas Adams]]'' (2003) by M. J. Simpson, with a [[foreword]] in the UK edition by [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]] (ISBN 0-340-82488-3), and was revised and updated in paperback in February 2004 (ISBN 0-340-82489-1). The American hardback edition contains a foreword by [[Neil Gaiman]] (ISBN 1-932112-17-0), and its April 2005 paperback equivalent (ISBN 1-932112-35-9) has an extra chapter about the movie. 

Upon the mutual discovery that Webb and Simpson were both working on new posthumous biographies, the two authors agreed that the former would focus on Adams's life and personality, and the latter on his work.

In 1992, ITV's ''[[The South Bank Show]]'' produced a documentary about Douglas Adams which featured Dirk Gently and characters from Hitchhikers and contributions from Stephen Fry, Richard Dawkins and John Lloyd.

The BBC produced a tribute as part of their TV series ''Omnibus''. It was first broadcast on BBC 2 on [[4 August]] [[2001]], presented by [[Kirsty Wark]]. The programme included interviews with [[Stephen Fry]], [[Clive Anderson]], [[Terry Jones]], [[Griff Rhys Jones]], [[Richard Dawkins]] and John Lloyd, among others. A copy is included with the Region One DVD release of the ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' TV series. 

A movie documentary, ''Life, The Universe and Douglas Adams'', was released in 2002, directed and produced by Rick Mueller and Joel Greengrass. Archive footage of Adams is generously included, as well as interviews with Adams's friends, colleagues and family. This documentary was narrated by [[Neil Gaiman]] and is available on VHS tape.<ref>[http://www.douglasadams.com/news/#20020415-0-n.dna Press release announcing the] ''Life, the Universe, and Douglas Adams'' documentary video from [[15 April]] [[2002]].</ref>

Earlier biographies include:

*M. J. Simpson's book ''The Pocket Essential Hitchhiker's Guide'' was first published in April 2001 in the UK (ISBN 1-903047-40-4), and revised and reprinted after the death of Douglas Adams in October 2001. A third revision, (though titled the "Second, Revised Edition") was published in April 2005 in the UK, with new material (ISBN 1-904048-46-3).

[[Image:Starship Titanic box art.jpg|thumb|Front cover of the box from the original US Windows 95 CD-ROM release of ''Starship Titanic'', by Simon & Schuster Interactive.]]

''''' Starship Titanic''''' is a [[computer game]] designed by [[Douglas Adams]] and made by [[The Digital Village]].  It was released in [[1998]].  It takes place on a starship of the same name which has undergone "Spontaneous Massive Existence Failure" and crash landed on [[Earth]] on its maiden voyage (in an allusion to the [[1912]] disaster involving the real-world [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']]).

The player acts the part of a human (whose house the starship crashed into) who goes aboard to help fix the ship, and must solve puzzles to collect the parts of the sabotaged onboard computer, Titania. Once all the parts have been collected and inserted in the correct places, Titania comes alive and talks.

One of the most significant parts of the game is the conversation engine (dubbed [[Spookitalk]]) used to interact with the robot staff onboard the ship. Players type what they wish to say into the Personal Electronic Thing (PET) at the bottom of the screen. The robots' responses appear as text in the PET and are also spoken. The conversation engine works by interpreting user input and selecting relevant pre-recorded speech responses.

A feature of the game and the starship itself is the "Succ-U-Bus", a communications system which moves physical containers through a network of tubes by vacuum. Messages and objects can be placed in the containers, and the system is used to deliver items to the player from other locations. The name of the system is a play on the word "[[succubus]]." Similar systems called [[pneumatic tube]]s exist in the real world; for example, those used by [[supermarket]]s to offload cash from tills to a secure area.

Among the voice actors for the game are former [[Monty Python]] members [[Terry Jones]] as the Parrot, and [[John Cleese]] (under the pseudonym of Kim Bread) as the Bomb<ref>"Wish You Were Here, The Official Biography of Douglas Adams", Nick Webb, p. 326.</ref>. Adams himself is the voice of the Succ-U-Bus, and plays the part of the ship's creator, Leovinus, in one of the closing scenes.  If you turn on the television in the prologue of the game Douglas Adams will appear and tell you to get on with the game.

A book entitled ''Douglas Adams's Starship Titanic'', based on the game, was written by Jones. Critical reaction has been lukewarm; the general consensus is that the novel reads like a poor imitation of Adams' style. In an unusual move for a publisher, the contents of the novel -- every word -- has been published on the official Starship Titanic website. The words are in alphabetical order, for convenience in referencing them, although readability suffers somewhat.

The Starship Titanic and Spontaneous Massive Existence Failure were first mentioned in ''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]'', the third book in the ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' "trilogy". This would seem to suggest that the game takes place in the same fictional universe as the ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' stories. However, in response to mentions of characters or quotations from the ''Hitchhiker's Guide'', the game will accuse the player of mixing up different universes.

Prior to the game's release, the publishers launched a web site purporting to be that of an intergalactic travel agency called Starlight Travel, which in the game is the Starship Titanic's parent company. The site combined copious amounts of Python-esque writing (by Terry Jones) with methods commonly associated with Alternative Reality Games to generate interest in the site, and in the game, long after the initial site visit. A typical example of this occurred when a site visitor filled out a personal information form, including email address and "favorite frog" (from a convenient -- and long -- drop-down list); approximately one week later, a spam email for something other than Starlight Travel would arrive, and would include a reference to the specific frog that the visitor had selected. Another example involved a series of three emails; the first called the reader's attention to a password-protected area of the ''Starlight Travel'' site, the second urged the reader to delete unread any future emails, as confidential information was being erroneously emailed, and the third revealed the confidential password for the restricted site: "1".

### title = Douglas Adams Society
### content
The '''Douglas Adams Society''', or '''DougSoc''' for short, is the name given to a [[Student society|student society]] formed at various [[United Kingdom|British]] [[University|universities]] to honour the spirit engendered in [[Douglas Adams]]' works.  Notable DougSocs exist, or have existed, at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], [[University of York|York]] and [[University of Exeter|Exeter]] universities<ref>[http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~socs242/ York University DougSoc homepage].</ref><ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/19981207032831/users.ox.ac.uk/~dougsoc/ Archived pages] of the now-disbanded [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] Douglas Adams Society at the [[Internet Archive]].</ref>.

While Adams is known to have disapproved of the establishment of societies in his name (he allegedly referred in conversation to the Oxford University DougSoc as "a bunch of [[wanker]]s"<ref>Alleged personal conversation [June 1995] with the original Oxford cast of ''[[Dirk (play)|Dirk]]'', supposedly relayed to members of the Oxford DougSoc by parties of dubious reliability during a period of inebriation for all concerned.</ref>), in reality the activities of such groups focus very little on the author, and more on getting [[drunk]], writing and performing revues, [[role playing]] [[pub crawl]]s, and other somewhat creative activities<ref>[http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~socs242/schedule.html Current programme of events] for [[University of York|York]] DougSoc.</ref>.

== Oxford DougSoc ==

The original Douglas Adams Society was founded at Oxford University in 1990, and continued as a university institution until 2000.  While the early termly programmes tended to focus on Adams and his works, as the society grew the focus shifted towards more generalised social activities themed around [[science fiction]] and [[comedy]]<ref>
[http://www.niddle.net/about/mich94.htm Archived termcards] from the Oxford DougSoc.</ref>. 

Nevertheless, the Oxford DougSoc maintained a popular image as a specifically Adams-themed society, finding this particularly useful in recruitment of new members.  The society became well-known for its presence at  [[Orientation week#United Kingdom|Freshers' Fair]], where members would typically wear [[Robe|dressing gowns]] and hand out [[Tea bag|teabags]].  Freshers' recruitment events invariably involved home-mixed [[Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster|pan-galactic gargle blasters]] and two different types of [[cheese]].  At its height, the Oxford society boasted some 50 members and enjoyed considerable notoriety among the Oxford student community.

As well as more traditional posts, the DougSoc committee included a Society [[Poet]] and a Small Furry Creatures Rep.  

Typical DougSoc activities included:

* [[Races and species in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Vogons|Vogon]] [[Vogon poetry|Poetry]] evenings;
* Role-playing pub crawls<ref>The Oxford DougSoc [http://www.niddle.net/creative/hitchhiker.htm role-playing pub crawls].</ref>;
* [[Childhood]] regression parties;
* [[Guy Fawkes' Night|Bonfire night]] celebrations;
* [[Sketch comedy]] evenings;
* [[Treasure hunt|Findy Things Evenings]];
* [[Costume party|Fancy dress parties]];
* Video evenings (generally oriented around science fiction or comedy);
* Formal dinners.

A termly magazine, ''Zarking Fardwarks'' (named after an oath used by [[Ford Prefect (character)|Ford Prefect]] in ''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]''), was published consisting of members' creative writing<ref>[http://www.niddle.net/creative/zf.htm Archived issues] of ''Zarking Fardwarks''.</ref>.  Members also formed a successful sketch comedy troupe known as Cruel and Unusual Punishment, later Square Pegs, which performed revues in Oxford and on the [[Edinburgh Fringe]].

Alumni of Oxford DougSoc went on to found the York and Exeter branches of the society.  In 2000, the Oxford DougSoc disbanded, to be replaced by a more nebulous network of individuals known as [niddle]<ref>The [niddle] [http://www.niddle.net/ website]</ref>.

'''''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy''''' is a [[Comic science fiction|science fiction comedy]] series created by [[Douglas Adams]]. It debuted as a [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (radio series)|radio comedy]] broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4]] in [[1978]]. Since then it has been adapted to other formats, slowly becoming an international multi-media phenomenon over a span of several years. Adaptations have included [[#Stage shows|stage shows]], a [[#Books|series of five books]] first published between 1979 and 1992 (the first of which was titled ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy''), a [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)|1981 TV series]], a [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (computer game)|1984 computer game]], and three series of three-part [[#Comic books|comic book adaptations]] of the first    three novels published by [[DC Comics]] between 1993 and 1996. There were also two series of towels, produced by Beer-Davies, that are considered by some fans to be an "official version" of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'', as they include text from the first novel.<ref>{{cite book | author=[[Neil Gaiman|Gaiman, Neil]] | title=Don't Panic: Douglas Adams and the "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" | publisher=Titan Books | year=2003|id=ISBN 1-84023-742-2|pages = Pages 144-145}}</ref><ref name="Kentfield">[http://www.towel.org.uk/ A wiki devoted to the history of H2G2 themed towels].</ref> A [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|Hollywood-funded film version]], produced and filmed in the UK, was released in April 2005, and [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases|adaptations of the last three books to radio]] were broadcast from 2004 to 2005. Many of these adaptations, including the novels, the TV series, the computer game, and the earliest drafts of the Hollywood film's screenplay, were all done by Adams himself, and some of the stage shows debuted new material written by Adams.

The title ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy''<ref>The spelling of ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' has varied in different editions.  For consistency this article always spells it this way.  See [[Spelling of Hitchhiker's Guide]].</ref> is often abbreviated as  "'''HHGTTG'''", (as used on fan websites) or "'''H2G2'''" (first used by [[Neil Gaiman]] as a chapter title in ''[[Don't Panic: The Official Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Companion|Don't Panic]]'' and later by [[h2g2|the online guide run by the BBC]]). The series is also often referred to as "'''The Hitchhiker's Guide'''", "'''Hitchhiker's'''", or simply "'''[The] Guide'''." This title can refer to any of the various incarnations of the story of which the books are the most widely distributed, having been translated into more than 30 languages by 2005<ref>{{cite book | author=Simpson, M. J. | title=The Pocket Essential Hitchhiker's Guide | edition=Second Edition | publisher=Pocket Essentials | year=2005|id=ISBN 1-904048-46-3|pages = Page 120}}</ref>. The title can also refer to the [[fictional guidebook]] [[The Guide (character)|''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'']], an eccentric electronic [[encyclopedia]] that features in the series.

Although the various versions follow the same basic plot, they are in many places mutually contradictory, as Adams rewrote the story substantially for each new adaptation. In all versions, the series follows the adventures of [[Arthur Dent]], a hapless [[English people|Englishman]] who, with his friend [[Ford Prefect (character)|Ford Prefect]], an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of [[Betelgeuse]] and researcher for the [[eponym]]ous guidebook, escapes the demolition of Earth by a bureaucratic alien race called the [[Races and Species in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Vogons|Vogons]]. [[Zaphod Beeblebrox]], Ford's semi-cousin and part-time Galactic President, unknowingly saves the pair from certain death. He brings them aboard his stolen spaceship, the ''[[Heart of Gold (spaceship)|Heart of Gold]]'', whose crew rounds out the main cast of characters: [[Marvin the Paranoid Android]], a [[Clinical depression|depressed]] [[robot]], and [[Trillian (character)|Trillian]], formerly known as Tricia McMillan, a woman Arthur once met at a party who he soon realises is the only other survivor of Earth's destruction.  After this, the characters embark on a quest to find the legendary planet of [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Magrathea|Magrathea]] and the [[The Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything|Question to the Ultimate Answer]].

==Origin of ''The Guide''==
The first radio series comes from a proposal called 'The Ends of the Earth': six self-contained episodes, all ending with the Earth being destroyed in a different way. While writing the first episode, Adams realised that he needed someone on the planet who was an alien to provide some context, and that this alien needed a reason to be there. Adams finally settled on making the alien a roving researcher for a "wholly remarkable book" named ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy''. As the first radio episode's writing progressed, the Guide became the centre of his story, and he decided to focus the series on it, with the destruction of Earth being the only hold-over.<ref>{{cite book | author=[[Nick Webb (author)|Webb, Nick]] | title=Wish You Were Here: The Official Biography of Douglas Adams | edition=First US hardcover edition | publisher=Ballantine Books | year=2005 | pages = Page 100 | id=ISBN 0-345-47650-6}}</ref>

Adams claimed that the title came from a 1971 incident while he was [[hitch-hiking]] around [[Europe]] as a young man with a copy of the ''[[Hitch-hiker's Guide to Europe]]'' book, and while lying drunk in a field in [[Innsbruck]] with a copy of the book and looking up at the stars, thought it would be a good idea for someone to write a hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy as well. However, he later claimed that he had told this story so many times that he had forgotten the incident itself, and only remembered himself telling the story. His friends are quoted as saying that Adams mentioned the idea of "hitch-hiking around the galaxy" to them while on holiday in Greece, in 1973.<ref>{{cite book | author=Simpson, M. J. | title=Hitchhiker: A Biography of Douglas Adams | edition=First US Edition | publisher=Justin Charles & Co. | year=2003 | id=ISBN 1-932112-17-0 | pages = Page 340}}</ref>

Adams's fictional ''Guide'' is meant to be an electronic guidebook to the [[Milky Way]] galaxy, originally published by [[Megadodo Publications]], one of the great publishing houses of [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Ursa Minor Beta|Ursa Minor Beta]]. The narrative of the various versions of the story are frequently punctuated with excerpts from the Guide. The voice of the Guide ([[Peter Jones]] in the first two radio series and TV versions, later [[William Franklyn]] in the third, fourth and fifth radio series, and [[Stephen Fry]] in the movie version), also provides general narration.

==Original radio series==
{{See also|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (radio series)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases}}

The [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#The Primary Phase|first radio series]] of six episodes (called "Fits" after the names of the sections of [[Lewis Carroll]]'s nonsense poem ''[[The Hunting of the Snark]]'')<ref>[http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=fit&x=0&y=0 Merriam-Webster Online] definition of 'fit'.</ref> was broadcast in 1978 on [[BBC Radio 4]]. Despite a low-key launch of the series (the first episode was broadcast at 10:30 p.m. on Wednesday, [[8 March]] 1978), it received generally good reviews and a tremendous audience reaction for radio.<ref>{{cite book | author=Simpson, M. J. | title=The Pocket Essential Hitchhiker's Guide | edition=Second Edition | publisher=Pocket Essentials | year=2005 | id=ISBN 1-904048-46-3 | pages =Page 33}}</ref> A one-off episode (a "Christmas special") was broadcast later in the year. The BBC was in the practice, at the time, of commissioning "Christmas Special" episodes for popular radio series, and while an early draft of this episode of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide'' had a Christmas-related plotline, it was decided to be "in slightly poor taste" and the episode as transmitted served as a bridge between the two series.<ref>{{cite book | author=Adams, Douglas | editor = Geoffrey Perkins (ed.), additional Material by M. J. Simpson. | title=[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: The Original Radio Scripts]] | edition=25th Anniversary Edition | publisher=Pan Books | year=2003|id=ISBN 0-330-41957-9|pages =Page 147}}</ref> This episode was released as part of the second radio series and, later, ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#The Secondary Phase|The Secondary Phase]]'' on cassettes and CDs. The Primary and Secondary Phases were aired, in a slightly edited version, in the United States on [[NPR Playhouse]].  

The first series was repeated twice in 1978 alone and many more times in the next few years. This led to an [[#LP album adaptations|LP re-recording]], produced independently of the BBC for sale, and a further adaptation of the series as a book. A second radio series, which consisted of a further five episodes, and bringing the total number of episodes to 12, was broadcast in 1980.

The radio series (and the LP and TV versions) greatly benefited from the [[narration]] of noted comedy actor Peter Jones as The Book. He was cast after it was decided that a "Peter-Jonesy" sort of voice was required. His sonorous, avuncular tones undoubtedly gave the series a tremendous boost and firmly established the tenor of the piece. 

The series was also notable for its use of sound, being the first comedy series to be produced in [[Stereophonic sound|stereo]]. Adams said that he wanted the programme's production to be comparable to that of a modern rock album. Much of the programme's budget was spent on sound effects, which were largely the work of [[Paddy Kingsland]] (for the pilot episode and the complete second series) and [[Dick Mills]] and [[Harry Parker]] (for the remaining episodes (2-6) of the first series.) The fact that they were at the forefront of modern radio production in 1978 and 1980 was reflected when the three new series of ''Hitchhiker's'' became some of the first radio shows to be mixed into 4 channel [[dolby surround]]. This mix was also featured on DVD releases of the third radio series.

The theme tune used for the radio, television, LP and film versions is "Journey of the Sorcerer", an [[instrumental]] piece composed by [[Bernie Leadon]] and recorded by [[The Eagles]] on their album ''[[One of These Nights]]''. Only the transmitted radio series used the original recording; a soundalike cover by [[Tim Souster]] was used for the LP and TV series, another arrangement by [[Joby Talbot]] was used for the 2005 film, and still another arrangement, this time by [[Philip Pope]], was recorded to be released with the CDs of the last three radio series. Apparently, Adams chose this song for its futuristic sounding nature, but also for the fact that it had a [[banjo]] in it, which, as [[Geoffrey Perkins]] recalls, Adams said would give it an "on the road, hitch-hiking feel."<ref>Ibid. Page 32.</ref>

The twelve episodes were released on [[compact disc|CD]] and [[Compact audio cassette|cassette]] in 1988, becoming the first CD release in the [[BBC Radio Collection]]. They were re-released in 1992, and at this time Adams suggested that they could retitle Fits the First through Sixth as "The Primary Phase" and Fits the Seventh through Twelfth as "The Secondary Phase" instead of just "the first series" and "the second series".<ref>Ibid. Page 253.</ref> It was about at this time that a "Tertiary Phase" was first discussed with Dirk Maggs, adapting ''Life, the Universe and Everything'', but this series would not be recorded for another ten years.<ref>{{cite book|author=Adams, Douglas.|editor = [[Dirk Maggs]], dramatisations and editor. | title=The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Radio Scripts: The Tertiary, Quandary and Quintessential Phases | publisher=Pan Books | year=2005 | id=ISBN 0-330-43510-8 |pages=Page xiv}}</ref>

==Books==
The books are described as "a [[trilogy]] in five parts", having been described as a trilogy on the release of the third book, and then a "trilogy in four parts" on the release of the fourth book. The US edition of the fifth book was originally released with the legend "The fifth book in the increasingly inaccurately named Hitchhiker's Trilogy" on the cover. Subsequent re-releases of the other novels bore the legend "The [first, second, third, fourth] in the increasingly inaccurately named Hitchhiker's trilogy."

The plots of the television and radio series are more or less the same as that of the first two novels, though some of the events occur in a different order and many of the details are changed. Much of parts five and six of the radio series were written by John Lloyd, but his material did not make it into the other versions of the story and is not included here. Some consider the books' version of events to be definitive, because they are the most readily accessible and widely distributed version of the story. However, they are not the final version that Adams produced.

It was not truly clear that the series was over (since it was already a trilogy with five books) until Adams died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at age 49 in 2001. Indeed, Adams said that the new novel he was working on, ''[[The Salmon of Doubt]]'', was not working as a [[Dirk Gently]] story, and suggested it might instead become a sixth book in the ''Hitchhiker's'' series. He described ''Mostly Harmless'' in an interview as "a very bleak book" and said he "would love to finish Hitchhiker on a slightly more upbeat note". Adams also remarked that if he were to write a sixth installment, he would at least start with all the characters in the same place.<ref>{{cite book|author=Adams, Douglas| editor =[[Peter Guzzardi]] (ed.)| title=[[The Salmon of Doubt]]: Hitchhiking the Galaxy One Last Time | edition=First UK Edition | publisher=Macmillan | year=2002 | pages = Page 198 | id=ISBN 0-333-76657-1}}</ref>

===''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy''=== 
[[Image:H2G2 UK front cover.jpg|thumb|right|Cover of the original UK paperback edition of the novel ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy''.]]

In '''''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (book)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''''' (published in 1979), the characters visit the legendary planet Magrathea, home to the now-collapsed planet building industry, and meet [[Slartibartfast]], a planetary coastline designer who was responsible for the [[fjords]] of Norway. Through archival recordings, he relates the story of a race of hyper-intelligent pan-dimensional beings who built a [[computer]] named [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Deep Thought|Deep Thought]] to calculate the answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. When the answer was revealed as [[The Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything|42]], they were forced to build a more powerful computer to work out what the Ultimate Question actually was, but their plans never come to fruition. (Later on, referencing this, Adams would create a [[42 Puzzle|puzzle]] which could be approached in multiple ways, all yielding the answer 42.)

The computer, often mistaken for a planet (because of its size and use of biological components), was the Earth, and was destroyed by [[Races and Species in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Vogons|Vogons]] five minutes before the conclusion of its 10-million-year program. Two of the race of hyper-intelligent pan-dimensional beings, who turn out to be Trillian's [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Frankie and Benjy mouse|mice]], want to dissect Arthur's brain to help reconstruct the question, since he is the last remaining survivor from Earth at the moment when it was destroyed. Trillian is also human but had left Earth six months previously with Zaphod Beeblebrox. Our protagonists escape, setting course for "The Restaurant at the End of the Universe". The mice, in Arthur's absence, create a phony question since it is too troublesome for them to wait 10 million years again just to cash in on a lucrative deal. Their new question was "[[Blowin' in the Wind|How many roads must a man walk down?]]"

The book was adapted from the first four radio episodes. It was first published in 1979, initially in paperback, by [[Pan Books]], after [[BBC Publishing]] had turned down the offer of publishing a novelisation, an action they would later regret.<ref>{{cite book | author=Simpson, M. J. | title=Hitchhiker: A Biography of Douglas Adams | edition=First US Edition | publisher=Justin Charles & Co. | year=2003|pages = Page 131|id=ISBN 1-932112-17-0}}</ref> The book reached number one on the book charts in only its second week, and sold over 250,000 copies within three months of its release. A hardback edition was published by [[Harmony Books]], a division of [[Random House]] in the [[United States]] in October 1980, and the 1981 US paperback edition was promoted by the give-away of 3,000 free copies in the magazine ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' to build [[word of mouth]]. To this day, it has sold over 14 million copies.<ref>[http://contemporarylit.about.com/od/memoir/fr/dontPanic.htm Review of] [[Neil Gaiman]]'s ''[[Don't Panic: The Official Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Companion|Don't Panic]]''</ref> 

A [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (book)#Illustrated Edition|photo-illustrated edition]] of the first novel appeared in 1994.

===''The Restaurant at the End of the Universe''===
In '''''[[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe]]''''' (published in 1980), Zaphod is separated from the others and finds he is part of a [[Cabal|conspiracy]] to uncover who really runs the Universe. Zaphod meets [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Zarniwoop / Vann Harl|Zarniwoop]], a co-conspirator and editor for ''The Guide'', who knows where to find the secret ruler. Zaphod becomes briefly reunited with the others for a trip to [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Milliways|Milliways]], the restaurant of the title. Zaphod and Ford decide to steal a ship from there, which turns out to be a stunt ship which is headed for a star as effects in a stage show. The main characters get Marvin to run the teleporter they find in the ship, which is working other than having no automatic control, and Marvin seemingly sacrifices himself. Zaphod and Trillian discover that the Universe is in the safe hands of a simple man living on a remote planet in a wooden shack with his cat.

Ford and Arthur, meanwhile, end up on a spacecraft full of the outcasts of the [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Golgafrincham|Golgafrinchan]] civilisation. The ship crashes on [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] Earth; Ford and Arthur are stranded, and it becomes clear that the inept Golgafrinchans are the ancestors of modern humans, having displaced the Earth's indigenous hominids. This has disrupted the Earth's programming so that when Ford and Arthur manage to extract the final readout from Arthur's subconscious mind by pulling lettered tiles from a [[Scrabble]] set, it is "What do you get if you multiply six by nine?" Arthur then comments, "I've always said there was something fundamentally wrong with the universe." 
<!-- Please DO NOT change the above to "six by seven". "Six by nine" is the actual phrase used in the book, and is not a typo. -->

The book was adapted from the remaining material in the radio series — covering from the fifth episode to the twelfth episode, although the ordering was greatly changed (in particular, the events of [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#Fit the Sixth|Fit the Sixth]], with Ford and Arthur being stranded on pre-historic earth, end the book, and their rescue in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#Fit the Seventh|Fit the Seventh]] is deleted), and most of the [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Brontitall|Brontitall]] incident was omitted. Instead of the Haggunenon sequence, co-written by John Lloyd, the [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Hotblack Desatio|Disaster Area]] stuntship was substituted — this having first been introduced in the [[#LP album adaptations|LP version]].

===''Life, the Universe and Everything''===
In '''''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]''''' (published in 1982), Ford and Arthur travel through the space-time continuum from prehistoric Earth to [[Lord's Cricket Ground]]. There they run into Slartibartfast, who enlists their aid in preventing galactic war. Long ago, the people of [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Krikkit|Krikkit]] attempted to wipe out all life in the Universe, but they were stopped and imprisoned on their home planet; now they are poised to escape. With the help of Marvin, Zaphod and Trillian, our heroes prevent the destruction of life in the Universe and go their separate ways.

This was the first Hitchhiker's book originally written as a book and not adapted from radio. Its story was based on a treatment Adams had written for a [[Doctor Who]] movie,<ref>Gaiman, Appendix V: Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen</ref> with the Doctor role being split between Slartibartfast (to begin with), and later Trillian and Arthur. In 2004 it was adapted for radio as the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Tertiary Phase|Tertiary Phase]] of the radio series.

===''So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish''===
[[Image:Hitchhikers Quartet front.jpg|thumb|150px|The front cover of ''The Hitchhiker's Quartet'', a collection of the first four books in the series, published in the United States by Harmony Books in 1986.]]

In '''''[[So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish]]''''' (published in 1984), Arthur returns home to Earth, rather surprisingly since it was destroyed when he left. He meets and falls in love with a girl named [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Fenchurch|Fenchurch]], and discovers this Earth is a replacement provided by the [[dolphin]]s in their Save the Humans campaign. Eventually he rejoins Ford, who claims to have saved the Universe in the meantime, to hitch-hike one last time and see [[God's Final Message to His Creation]].  Along the way, they are joined by Marvin the Paranoid Android, who, although 37 times older than the universe itself (what with time travel and all), has just enough power left in his failing body to read the message and feel better about it all before expiring.

This was the first ''Hitchhiker's'' novel which was not an adaptation of any previously written story or script. In 2005 it was adapted for radio as the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Quandary Phase|Quandary Phase]] of the radio series.

===''Mostly Harmless''===
[[Image:Ultimate Hitchhikers Guide front.jpg|thumb|left|150px|The front cover of ''The Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide'', a collection of all five books in the series, a leatherbound volume published in the United States by Portland House, a division of Random House, in 1997.]]

Finally, in '''''[[Mostly Harmless]]''''' (published in 1992), Vogons take over ''The Hitchhiker's Guide'' (under the name of InfiniDim Enterprises), to finish, once and for all, the task of obliterating the Earth. After abruptly losing Fenchurch and travelling around the galaxy despondently, Arthur's spaceship crashes on the planet [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Lamuella|Lamuella]], where he settles in happily as the official sandwich-maker for a small village of simple, peaceful people. Meanwhile, Ford Prefect breaks into ''The Guide's'' offices, gets himself an infinite expense account from the computer system, and then meets ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Mark II'', an artificially intelligent, multi-dimensional guide with vast power and a hidden purpose. After he declines this dangerously powerful machine's aid (which he receives anyway), he sends it to Arthur Dent for safety ("Oh yes, whose?" — Arthur).

Trillian uses DNA that Arthur donated for travelling money to have a daughter, and when she goes to cover a war, she leaves her daughter [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Random Dent|Random Frequent Flyer Dent]] with Arthur. Random, a more-than-typically troubled teenager, steals ''The Guide Mark II'' and uses it to get to Earth. Arthur, Ford, Trillian, and Tricia McMillan (Trillian in this alternate universe) follow her to a crowded club, where an anguished Random tries to kill her father. The shot misses Arthur and kills a man (the ever-unfortunate [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Agrajag|Agrajag]]). Immediately afterwards, ''The Guide Mark II'' causes the removal of all possible Earths from probability. All of the main characters, save Zaphod, were on Earth at the time and are apparently killed, bringing a good deal of satisfaction to the Vogons.

In 2005 it was adapted for radio as the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Quintessential Phase|Quintessential Phase]] of the radio series, with the final episode first transmitted on [[21 June]] 2005.

===Other books===
Douglas Adams and Geoffrey Perkins collaborated on [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: The Original Radio Scripts]], first published in the [[United Kingdom]] and United States in 1985. A tenth anniversary edition was printed in 1995, and a twenty-fifth anniversary edition was printed in 2003.

A short story was also written, ''[[Young Zaphod Plays it Safe]]''. This story first appeared in ''[[The Utterly Utterly Merry Comic Relief Christmas Book]]'' a special large print compilation of different stories and pictures which raised money for the new (at the time) [[Comic Relief]] charity in the UK. It now appears in some of the omnibus editions of the trilogy, and in ''[[The Salmon of Doubt]]''. It is almost, but not quite, entirely unrelated to the rest of the trilogy. There are two versions of this story, one of which is slightly more explicit in its already heavy-handed political commentary.

A novel, ''[[Douglas Adams's Starship Titanic]]'' written by [[Terry Jones]], is based on Adams' computer game of the same name, which in turn is based on an idea from ''Life, the Universe and Everything''.

Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged, a character from ''Life, the Universe and Everything'', also appears in a short story by Adams titled ''The Private Life of [[Genghis Khan]]'' which appears in some early editions of ''The Salmon of Doubt''.

For some information on understanding the philosophy of the Guide, or Douglas Adams's influence on technology, see ''The Anthology at the End of the Universe,'' a series of essays edited by [[Glenn Yeffeth]], published in 2005.

[[Michael Hanlon]] published ''The Science of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' in 2005. Topics include space tourism, parallel universes, instant translation devices and sentient computers.

[[Dirk Maggs]], who adapted and dramatised the last three novels for radio, released a collection of their scripts in July 2005, with Maggs providing notes for each episode. This second radio script book is entitled ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Radio Scripts: The Tertiary, Quandary and Quintessential Phases''. Douglas Adams gets the primary writer's credit (as he wrote the original novels), and there is a foreword by [[Simon Jones (actor)|Simon Jones]], introductions by [[Bruce Hyman]] and Dirk Maggs, and other introductory notes from other members of the cast.

==TV series==
[[Image:Hitchhikers Guide TV Titles.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Opening titles from the TV series]]
{{main|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)}}

The popularity of the radio series gave rise to a six-episode television series, directed and produced by [[Alan J W Bell]], which first aired on [[BBC Two]] in January and February of 1981. It employed many of the actors from the radio series and was based mainly on the radio versions of Fits the First through Sixth. A second series was at one point planned, with a storyline, according to Alan Bell and Mark Wing-Davey, that would have come from Adams's abandoned ''Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen'' project (instead of simply making a TV version of the second radio series). However, Adams got into disputes with the BBC (accounts differ: problems with budget, scripts, and having Alan Bell and/or Geoffrey Perkins involved are all offered as causes), and the second series was never made. The elements of the ''Doctor Who and the Krikketmen'' project instead became the third novel, ''Life, the Universe and Everything''.

The main cast was the same as the [[#The original radio series|original radio series]], except for [[David Dixon]] as Ford Prefect instead of McGivern, and [[Sandra Dickinson]] as Trillian instead of Sheridan.

===Other television appearances===
Segments of several of the books were adapted as part of the [[BBC]]'s "Big Read" survey and programme, broadcast in late 2003. The film directed by [[Deep Sehgal]] starred [[Sanjeev Bhaskar]] as Arthur Dent, alongside [[Stephen Hawking]] as Deep Thought and a host of British [[alternative comedians]] influenced by the work of Douglas Adams.{{Fact|date=March 2007}}

==Radio series three to five==
{{main|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases}}

On [[21 June]] [[2004]], the BBC announced in a press release<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2004/06_june/21/radio4.shtml BBC Press Office release], announcing a new series (the third) to be transmitted on BBC Radio 4 beginning in September 2004.</ref> that a new series of Hitchhiker's based on the third novel would be broadcast as part of its autumn schedule, produced by [[Above the Title Productions]] Ltd. The episodes were recorded in late 2003, but actual transmission was delayed while an agreement was reached with [[The Walt Disney Company]] over Internet re-broadcasts, as Disney had begun pre-production on the film.<ref>Webb, page 324.</ref> This was followed by news that further series would be produced based on the fourth and fifth novels. These were broadcast in September and October 2004 and May and June 2005. CD releases accompanied the transmission of the final episode in each series.

The adaptation of the third novel followed the book very closely, which caused major structural issues in branching with the preceding radio series in comparison to the second novel. Because events in the second novel were written in a different order from the second radio series and several events were omitted, the two series split in completely different directions. The last two adaptations vary somewhat — some events in ''Mostly Harmless'' are now foreshadowed in the adaptation of ''So Long and Thanks For All The Fish'', while both include some additional material that builds on incidents in the third series to tie all five (and their divergent plotlines) together, most especially including the character Zaphod more prominently in the final chapters and addressing his altered reality to include the events of the Secondary Phase. While ''Mostly Harmless'' originally contained a rather bleak ending, Dirk Maggs created a different ending for the transmitted radio version, ending it on a much more upbeat note, reuniting the cast one last time.

The core cast for the third through fifth radio series remained the same, except for the replacement of [[Peter Jones]] by [[William Franklyn]] as the Book, and Richard Vernon by [[Richard Griffiths]] as Slartibartfast, since both had died. [[Sandra Dickinson]], who played Trillian in the TV series, here played Tricia McMillan, an English born, American accented alternate-universe version of Trillian, while [[David Dixon]], the television series' Ford Prefect, made a cameo appearance as the "Ecological Man".  [[Jane Horrocks]] appeared in the new semi-regular role of Fenchurch, and [[Samantha Béart]] joined in the final series as Arthur and Trillian's daughter, Random.  Also reprising their roles from the original radio series were [[Jonathan Pryce]] as Zarniwoop (here blended with a character from the final novel to become Zarniwoop Vann Harl), [[Rula Lenska]] as Lintilla (and also as the Voice of the Bird), and [[Roy Hudd]] as Milliways compere Max Quordlepleen, as well as the original radio series' announcer, John Marsh.  

The series also featured guest appearances by such noted personalities as [[Joanna Lumley]] as the Sydney Opera House Woman, [[Jackie Mason]] as the East River Creature, [[Miriam Margolyes]] as the Smelly Photocopier Woman, BBC Radio cricket legends [[Henry Blofeld]] and [[Fred Trueman]] as themselves, [[June Whitfield]] as the Raffle Woman, [[Leslie Phillips]] as Hactar, [[Saeed Jaffrey]] as the Man on the Pole, [[Sir Patrick Moore]] as himself, and [[Christian Slater]] as Wonko the Sane.  Finally, Adams himself played the role of Agrajag... a performance adapted from his book-on-tape reading of the third novel, and edited into the series he created some time after the author's death.

[[Image:hitchhikers guide to the galaxy ver2 movie poster.jpg|thumb|200 px|right|Theatrical poster for the film of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''.]]After years of setbacks and renewed efforts to start production and a quarter of a century after the first book was published, the big-screen adaptation of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' was finally shot. Pre-production began in 2003, filming began on [[19 April]] [[2004]] and post-production began in early September of 2004.<ref>{{cite book | author=[[Robbie Stamp|Stamp, Robbie]], editor | title=The Making of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: The Filming of the Douglas Adams Classic | publisher=Boxtree | year=2005|pages = Page 12|id=ISBN 0-7522-2585-5}}</ref> After a [[London]] premiere on [[20 April]] [[2005]], it was released on [[28 April]] in the UK and [[Australia]], [[29 April]] in the United States and [[Canada]], and [[29 July]] in [[South Africa]]. (A full list of release dates is available at the [[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]].<ref>[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371724/releaseinfo IMDb page] for the release dates of the movie adaptation of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.''</ref>) The movie stars [[Martin Freeman]] as Arthur, [[Mos Def]] as Ford, [[Sam Rockwell]] as President of the Galaxy Zaphod Beeblebrox and [[Zooey Deschanel]] as Trillian, with [[Alan Rickman]] providing the voice of Marvin the Paranoid Android (and [[Warwick Davis]] acting in Marvin's costume), and [[Stephen Fry]] as the voice of the Guide/Narrator.

The plot of the film adaptation of ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' differs widely from that of the radio show, book and television series. The romantic triangle between Arthur, Zaphod, and Trillian is more prominent in the plot; and visits to Vogsphere, the homeworld of the Vogons (in the books it was already abandoned), and [[Places in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Viltvodle VI|Viltvodle VI]] is inserted. The film covers roughly events in the first four radio episodes, and ends with the characters en route to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, leaving the opportunity for a sequel open.

Reactions to the film were mixed,<ref>[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hitchhikers_guide_to_the_galaxy/ Various reviews], by critics and fans, of the movie adaptation of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' at rottentomatoes.com.</ref> both within and outside fandom. Some fans felt essential elements of the humour and philosophy had been lost in the adaptation, and the introduction of a romantic subplot was an unnecessary Hollywoodism, whereas criticism from some reviewers held that the film had good intentions but the pacing was problematic. It is therefore considered by many that the humour and philosophy elements were purposefully slanted more towards the American market and to work within the confines of a roughly two hour film, and hence, the story was reworked by Adams as such. Commercially the film was a modest success, taking [[United States dollars|$]]21 million in its opening weekend in the [[United States]], and nearly [[Pound sterling|£]]3.3 million in its opening weekend in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>[http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0371724/business Box office data page], including opening weekends for the US and UK releases of the 2005 movie.</ref>

The film was released on DVD (Region 2, PAL) in the UK on [[5 September]] [[2005]]. Both a standard double disc edition and a UK-exclusive numbered limited edition "Giftpack" were released on this date. The "Giftpack" edition includes a copy of the novel with a "movie tie-in" cover, and collectible prints from the film, packaged in a replica of the film's version of the ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' prop. A single disc widescreen or full-screen edition (Region 1, NTSC) were made available in the USA and [[Canada]] on [[13 September]] [[2005]]. Single disc releases in the [[Universal Media Disc|UMD]] format for the [[PlayStation Portable]] were also released on the respective dates in these three countries.

==Other adaptations==
[[Image:HHGG UKLP covers.jpg|thumb|200px|The front covers of the LP record adaptations of the first radio series, as released in the UK.]]

Hitchhiker's has also appeared as a stage show, three LP albums with condensed (and slightly contradictory) versions of the first six radio episodes, a text-only adventure computer game, and three series of comic books (with a set of collectors' cards spun off containing art from and inspired by, the first set of comics).

===Stage shows===
There have been multiple professional and amateur stage adaptations of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy''. There were three early professional productions, which were staged in 1979 and 1980.<ref>Gaiman, pages 61-66.</ref><ref>{{cite book | author=Simpson, M. J. | title=The Pocket Essential Hitchhiker's Guide | edition=Second Edition | pages = Pages 48-57 | publisher=Pocket Essentials | year=2005 | id=ISBN 1-904048-46-3}}</ref>

The first of these was performed at the [[Institute for Contemporary Arts]] in London, between 1st-[[9 May]] [[1979]], starring [[Chris Langham]] as Arthur Dent (Langham later returned to ''Hitchhiker's'' as [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Prak|Prak]] in the final episode of 2004's Tertiary Phase). This show was adapted from the first series' scripts and was directed by [[Ken Campbell (actor)|Ken Campbell]], who went on to perform a character in the final episode of the second radio series. The show ran 90 minutes, but had an audience limited to eighty people per night. Actors performed on a variety of ledges and platforms, and the audience was pushed around in a hovercar, 1/2000th of an inch above the floor. This was the first time that Zaphod was represented by having two actors in one large costume. The narration of "The Book" was split between two usherettes, an adaptation that has appeared in no other version of H2G2. One of these usherettes, [[Cindy Oswin]], went on to voice Trillian for the LP adaptation.

The second stage show was performed throughout Wales between [[15 January]] and [[23 February]] [[1980]]. This was a production of [[Clwyd Theatr Cymru]], and was directed by Jonathan Petherbridge. The company performed adaptations of complete radio episodes, at times doing two episodes in a night, and at other times doing all six episodes of the first series in single three hour sessions. This adaptation was performed again at the Oxford Playhouse in December 1981 and also at the [[Belgrade Theatre]], [[Coventry]] in July 1983.

The third, and least successful stage show was held at the [[Rainbow Theatre]] in London, in July 1980. This was the second production directed by Ken Campbell. The Rainbow Theatre had been adapted for stagings of rock operas in the 1970s, and both reference books mentioned in footnotes indicate that this, coupled with incidental music throughout the performance, caused some reviewers to label it as a "musical". This was the first adaptation for which Adams wrote the "Dish of the Day" sequence. The production ran for over three hours, and was widely panned for this, as well as the music, laser effects, and the acting. Despite attempts to shorten the script, and make other changes, it closed three or four weeks early (accounts differ), and lost a lot of money. Despite the bad reviews, there were at least two stand out performances: [[Michael Cule]] and [[David Learner]] both went on from this production to appearances in the TV adaptation.

Future stage production rights got tied up with the rights to make the film, though various amateur adaptations appeared worldwide at least up to 2004.

===LP album adaptations===
[[Image:HHGG REU cassette covers.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The front covers of the US cassette releases of the audio adaptations of the first radio series. These are slightly abridged versions of the original LP editions, with a couple of scenes cut for timing.]]

The first four radio episodes were adapted for a new double LP, also entitled ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'', first by mail-order only, and later into stores. The double LP and its sequel were originally released by [[Original Records]] in the United Kingdom, in 1979 and 1980 with the catalogue numbers ORA042 and ORA054 respectively. They were first released by [[Hannibal Records]] in 1982 (as HNBL 2301 and HNBL 1307, respectively) in the United States and Canada, and later re-released in a slightly abridged edition by Simon & Schuster's Audioworks in the mid-1980s.

{{Listen|filename=Hitch Hikers Theme Original Records Version.ogg
|title=Hitchhiker's theme, ''Journey of the Sorcerer'', Original Records version excerpt}}

The script in the first double LP very closely follows the first four radio episodes, although further cuts had to be made for reasons of timing. Despite this, other lines of dialogue that were indicated as having been cut when [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: The Original Radio Scripts|the original scripts from the radio series]] were eventually published can be heard in the LP version. The Simon & Schuster cassettes omit the Veet Voojagig narration, the cheerleader's speech as Deep Thought concludes its seven-and-one-half million year programme, and a few other lines from both sides of the second LP of the set.

Most of the original cast returned, except for [[Susan Sheridan]], who was recording a voice for the character of [[Princess Eilonwy]] in ''[[The Black Cauldron (film)|The Black Cauldron]]'' for [[Walt Disney Pictures]]. [[Cindy Oswin]] voiced Trillian on all three LPs in her place. Other casting changes in the first double LP included [[Stephen Moore (actor)|Stephen Moore]] taking on the additional role of the barman, and [[Valentine Dyall]] as the voice of Deep Thought. Adams' voice can be heard making the Public Address announcements on Magrathea. 

Due to copyrights, the music used during the first radio series was either replaced, or in the case of the title, it was re-recorded in a new arrangement. Composer Tim Souster did both duties, and his version of the theme was the version also used for the eventual television series.<ref>Simpson, MJ, ''Hitchhiker'', page 143</ref>

The sequel LP was released, singly, as ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Part Two: The Restaurant at the End of the Universe'' in the UK, and simply as ''The Restaurant at the End of the Universe'' in the USA. The script here mostly follows Fit the Fifth and Fit the Sixth, but includes a song by the backup band in the restaurant ("Reg Nullify and his Cataclysmic Combo"), and changes the Haggunenon sequence to "Disaster Area".

|title=Reg Nullify and his Cataclysmic Combo excerpt}}

Due to a misunderstanding, the second record was released before being cut down in a "final edit" that Douglas Adams and Geoffrey Perkins both had intended to make. Perkins has said, "[I]t is far too long on each side. It's just a rough cut. [...] I felt it was flabby, and I wanted to speed it up."<ref>Gaiman, Pages 72-73.</ref> The Simon & Schuster Audioworks re-release of this LP was also abridged slightly from its original release. The scene with Ford Prefect and Hotblack Desiato's bodyguard is omitted.

Sales for the first double-LP release were primarily through mail order. Total sales reached over 60,000 units, with half of those being mail order, and the other half through retail outlets.<ref>{{cite book | author=Simpson, M.

===Interactive fiction and video games===
{{main|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (computer game)}}
Sometime between 1982 and 1984 (accounts differ) the British company [[Supersoft]] published a text-based [[adventure game]] based on the book, which was released in versions for the [[Commodore PET]] and [[Commodore 64]]. One account states that there was a dispute as to whether valid permission for publication had been granted, and following legal action the game was withdrawn and all remaining copies were destroyed. Another account states that the programmer, Bob Chappell, rewrote the game to remove all ''Hitchhiker's'' references, and republished it as "Cosmic Capers".<ref>[http://www.inform-fiction.org/manual/html/s47.html#p376 Design Manual] for the [[Interactive Fiction]] language [[Inform]]. Accessed 2 August 2006. See also [http://www.inform-fiction.org/manual/html/cited.html their works cited] under "Hitchhiker-64".</ref>

Officially, the TV series was followed in 1984 by a best-selling "[[interactive fiction]]", or text-based [[adventure game]], distributed by [[Infocom]]. It was designed by Adams and Infocom regular [[Steve Meretzky]] and was one of Infocom's most successful games. As with many Infocom games, the box contained a number of "[[feelies]]" including a "Don't panic" badge, some "pocket fluff", a pair of peril-sensitive sunglasses, an order for the destruction of the Earth, a small, clear plastic bag containing "a microscopic battle fleet" and an order for the destruction of Arthur Dent's house (signed by Adams and Meretzky).

In September 2004 it was revived by the BBC on the Hitchhiker's section of the Radio 4 website for the initial broadcast of the Tertiary Phase, and is still available to play online.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/hitchhikers/ BBC Radio 4's ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' homepage].</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/hitchhikers/game.shtml New online version] of the 1984 ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' computer game, by Steve Meretzky and Douglas Adams.</ref> This new version uses an original Infocom datafile with a custom-written interpreter, by Sean Sollé, and Flash programming by Shimon Young, both of whom used to work at [[The Digital Village]] (TDV). The new version includes illustrations by [[Rod Lord]], who was head of [[Pearce Animation Studios]] in 1980, which produced the guide graphics for the TV series. On [[2 March]] [[2005]] it won the [[BAFTA Interactive Awards|Interactive BAFTA]] in the "best online entertainment" category.

A sequel to the original Infocom game was never made. An all new, fully graphical game, was designed and developed by a joint venture between [[The Digital Village]] and [[PAN Interactive]] (no connection to Pan Books/Pan Mcmillan).<ref>In late 2000 the TDV/Pan venture was spun off as a [http://tdv.com/phase3/ separate company, Phase 3 Studios]</ref><ref>[http://tdv.com/html/news/19990920-1-n.html 1999 TDV Press Release about the graphical ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' game.]</ref> This new game was planned and developed between 1998 and 2002, but like the sequel to the Infocom game, it also never materialised.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20060419095154/www.planetmagrathea.com/gameindex.html Internet Archive Wayback Machine] copy of information about the aborted Hitchhiker's Guide graphical PC game, originally posted on MJ Simpson's PlanetMagrathea.com site</ref>
In April 2005 [[Starwave]] Mobile released two mobile games to accompany the release of the film adaptation. The first, developed by Atatio, was called "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: Vogon Planet Destructor".<ref>[http://wireless.ign.com/articles/608/608605p1.html Webpage about the "Vogon Planet Destructor"] game hosted at ign.com.</ref> It was a typical top-down shooter and except for the title had little to do with the actual story. The second game, developed by [[TKO Software]], was a graphical adventure game named "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: Adventure Game".<ref>[http://wireless.ign.com/articles/608/608604p1.html Webpage about ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'': Adventure Game] hosted at ign.com.</ref> Despite its name the newly designed puzzles by Sean Sollé were different from the Infocom ones, and the game followed the movie's script closely and included the new characters and places. The "Adventure Game" won the [[IGN]]'s "Editors' Choice Award" on May 2005.

===Comic books===
[[Image:H2G2 first comic front cover.jpg|thumb|150px|The front cover of the [[DC Comics]] adaptation of the first book.]]

In 1993, DC Comics, in conjunction with [[Byron Preiss Visual Media]], published a three part comic book adaptation of the novelisation of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.'' This was followed up with three part adaptations of ''The Restaurant at the End of the Universe'' in 1994, and ''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]'' in 1996. There was also a series of collectors' cards with art from and inspired by the comic adaptations of the first book, and a graphic novelisation (or "collected edition") combining the three individual comic books from 1993, itself released in May 1997.

=="Hitch-Hikeriana"==
Many merchandising and spin-off items (or "Hitch-Hikeriana") were produced in the early 1980s, including towels in different colours, all bearing the Guide entry for towels. Later runs of towels include those made for promotions by Pan Books, Touchstone Pictures/Disney for the 2005 movie, and different towels made for [[ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha]], the official ''Hitchhiker's'' Appreciation society.<ref name="Kentfield" /> Other items that first appeared in the mid-1980s were t-shirts, including those made for Infocom (such as one bearing the legend "I got the Babel Fish" for successfully completing one of that game's most difficult puzzles), and a Disaster Area tour t-shirt. Other official items have included "Beeblebears" (teddy bears with an extra head and arm, named after ''Hitchhiker's'' character Zaphod Beeblebrox, sold by the official Appreciation Society), an assortment of pin-on buttons and a number of novelty singles. Many of the above items are displayed throughout the 2004 "25th Anniversary Illustrated Edition" of the novel, which used items from the personal collections of fans of the series.

[[Stephen Moore (actor)|Stephen Moore]] recorded two of the novelty singles in character as Marvin the Paranoid Android: "Marvin"/"Metal Man" and "Reasons To Be Miserable"/"Marvin, I Love You". The last song has appeared on a [[Dr. Demento]] compilation. There was also another single featuring the re-recorded "Journey of the Sorcerer" (arranged by Tim Souster) on side A with "Reg Nullify In Concert" by Reg Nullify, and "Only the End of the World Again" by Disaster Area (including Douglas Adams on bass guitar). These discs have since become collector's items.

The 2005 movie also added quite a few collectibles, mostly through the [[National Entertainment Collectibles Association]]. These included three prop replicas of objects seen on the Vogon ship and homeworld (a mug, a pen and a stapler), sets of "[[action figure]]s" with a height of either 3 or 6 inches, a gun, based on a prop used by Marvin the Paranoid Android that shoots foam darts, a crystal cube, shot glasses, a ten inch high version of Marvin with eyes that light up green, and "yarn doll" versions of Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect, Trillian, Marvin and Zaphod Beeblebrox. Also, various audio tracks were released to coincide with the movie, notably re-recordings of "Marvin" and "Reasons to be Miserable", sung by [[Stephen Fry]], along with some of the "[[Guide Entries]]", newly written material read in-character by Fry.

==The origin of the towel joke==
[[Image:DNA with H2G2 towel.JPG|thumb|left|190px|Douglas Adams with an officially licensed ''Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy''&nbsp; towel on his shoulder.]]

The full version of this story was first found in ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: The Original Radio Scripts]]'' and reprised in ''[[The Salmon of Doubt]]'', but the short version is as follows: Adams had gone on holiday in [[Greece]], but every time he had decided to go to the beach with his fellows, he discovered that his towel would disappear, and could only be found after hours of searching. 

After the holiday had ended, he decided that anyone who really had their life in order would "know where his towel is". He had no idea that this towel joke, which first appeared in the seventh radio episode, and subsequently in the first book, would catch on so brilliantly. 

He assumed, after learning that so many people liked and understood the joke, that he was not the only one with such an experience. After his death, [[Towel Day]] was established on [[May 25]] as a tribute.

==Cultural references==
{{main|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy cultural references}}
<!-- Please do not add new references to the paragraph here. They should be added in the article named above. -->

References to the series can be seen on websites, within TV and radio programmes, songs, and in console and computer games. Examples include borrowing Adams's characters' names, or references to the number 42, or other catchphrases, or even reusing "The Hitchhiker's Guide to ..." to title other books and articles (which Adams himself had borrowed from [[Ken Welsh (author)|Ken Welsh]]'s ''[[Hitch-hiker's Guide to Europe]]'').  ''Hitchhiker's'' references have also appeared in several series and episodes of another famous British science fiction series with which Adams was once affiliated: ''[[Doctor Who]]''. The online [[Babel Fish (website)|Babel Fish]] translation service was also named in honour of a fictional creature that Adams created for the ''Hitchhiker's'' series. Also, the instant message program, [[Trillian (instant messaging client)|Trillian]] is named after a character in ''Hitchhiker's'' series.  In the Cartoon Network show, Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, the one character Bloo is seen playing a video game in one episode in which "Lord Beeblebrox" takes over the galaxy.

==International phenomenon==
{{Main|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy as international phenomenon}}

Many science fiction fans and radio listeners outside the United Kingdom were first exposed to ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' in one of two ways: shortwave radio broadcasts of the original radio series, or by Douglas Adams being "Guest of Honour" at the 1979 [[Worldcon|World Science Fiction Convention]], Seacon, held in Brighton, England, UK. It was there that the radio series was nominated for a [[Hugo Award]] (the first radio series to receive a nomination) but lost to [[Superman: The Movie]]. A convention exclusively for ''H2G2'', Hitchercon I, was held in Glasgow, Scotland, UK, in September 1980, the year that the official fan club, [[ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha]], was organised. In the early 1980s, versions of ''H2G2'' became available in the United States, [[Canada]], [[Germany]], [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]]. 

During the 1990s, as ''Hitchhiker's'' fans appeared on the Internet, many took notice first of Douglas Adams's USENET newsgroup, and then his website. After the latter was closed following Adams's death, many fan websites and forums appeared on the World Wide Web to provide fans with another discussion venue.

'''''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''''' began as a [[comic science fiction|science fiction comedy]] [[radio]] series written by [[Douglas Adams]] (with some material in the first series provided by [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]]).<ref>The spelling of ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' has varied in different editions.  For consistency this article always spells it this way.  See [[Spelling of Hitchhiker's Guide]].</ref> It was originally broadcast in the [[United Kingdom]] over the [[BBC Radio|BBC]], soon followed by global [[short wave]] broadcast over the [[BBC World Service]], in 1978. Broadcasting by [[National Public Radio]] (one of their first to occur in stereo) in the [[United States]] followed in March, 1981, with a repeat broadcast in September.<ref>{{cite book | author=Adams, Douglas. | others=Introduction by M.J. Simpson | title=The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: 25th Anniversary Illustrated Collector's Edition | publisher=Harmony Books | year=2004 |id=ISBN 1-4000-5293-9 |pages=Page 38}}</ref> The following year, 1982, the BBC series was carried by [[CBC Radio]] ([[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]).

The series was first developed in 1977, with a pilot programme commissioned that March, and recorded by the end of the following June. The eventual complete first series was transmitted in 1978, a second series was commissioned in 1979, which itself was transmitted in 1980. Episodes of the first series were specially re-recorded for release on [[Gramophone_record|LP records]] and [[audio cassette|cassettes]]. After the 1980 transmissions of the second radio series, the first series was adapted for [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)|television]]; it included some material originally written by Adams for stage adaptations and the aforementioned LP adaptation. This in turn was followed by three further novels, a [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (computer game)|computer game]], and adaptations into three series of comic books.

Adams considered the creation of a third radio series, based on his novel ''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]'' in 1993 but the project did not begin for another ten years. [[Dirk Maggs]], with whom Adams had discussed the new series in 1993, 1997 and 2000, eventually directed and co-produced radio series adaptations of that novel, as well as ''[[So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish]]'' and ''[[Mostly Harmless]]''.<ref> {{cite book | author=Adams, Douglas. | editor = [[Dirk Maggs]], dramatizations and editor. | title=The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Radio Scripts: The Tertiary, Quandary and Quintessential Phases | publisher=Pan Books | year=2005 | id=ISBN 0-330-43510-8 |pages=Page xiv}}</ref> These became the third, fourth and fifth radio series. The third series was recorded in 2003 and transmitted in September and October 2004, and the fourth and fifth series were recorded in late 2004 and early 2005 and transmitted in May and June 2005. Recordings of all five series have now been released on [[audio cassette]] and [[compact disc]], and the third series was released on [[DVD]] in 2006, after being "delayed" more than once.<ref>[http://www.douglasadams.se/forum/viewtopic.php?t=5357 DouglasAdams.se Webchat with Dirk Maggs] [[June 16]], [[2005]]. Accessed 5 December 2006.</ref><ref>[http://www.douglasadams.se/forum/viewtopic.php?t=10313 DouglasAdams.se forum discussion] on the October 2006 release of the "Tertiary Phase" DVD.</ref>

==Early development==
[[Douglas Adams]] had contributed comedy sketches for BBC radio programmes produced by [[Simon Brett]] (including ''[[The Burkiss Way]]'' and ''[[Week Ending]]'', among others). The two of them came up with an idea for a radio science fiction comedy series in early 1977. Originally to be called ''The Ends of the Earth,'' each episode would have ended with the planet Earth meeting its demise in a different way.<ref>{{cite book | author=[[Nick Webb (author)|Webb, Nick]] | title=Wish You Were Here: The Official Biography of Douglas Adams | edition =First US hardcover edition | publisher=Ballantine Books | year=2005 | id=ISBN 0-345-47650-6 | pages=Page 100}}</ref>

While writing the first episode, Adams said that he needed a character who knew what was going to happen and provide a point of view. He decided to make this character an alien, and, remembering an idea he supposedly had had while lying drunk in a field in [[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]] in 1971, decided that this character would be a "roving reporter" for ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.'' Later recollections by his friends at the time indicate that Adams first spoke openly of the idea of "[[hitchhiking|hitch-hiking]] around the galaxy" while on holiday in Greece, in 1973.<ref>{{cite book | author=Simpson, M. J. | title=Hitchhiker: A Biography of Douglas Adams | edition =First U.S. Edition | publisher=Justin Charles & Co. | year=2003 | id=ISBN 1-932112-17-0 |pages=Pages 339-340}}</ref>
[[Image:DNA_Guide_to_H2G2_front.jpg|thumb|140px|The cover of the cassette release of the radio documentary ''Douglas Adams's Guide to the Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy''.]]

Adams wrote his first outlines in February 1977. Copies of these have been republished.<ref>{{cite book | author=[[Neil Gaiman|Gaiman, Neil]] | title=Don't Panic: Douglas Adams and the "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" | publisher=Titan Books | year=2003 | id=ISBN 1-84023-742-2 |pages=Pages 208-211}}</ref> A pilot episode was commissioned on [[March 1]], [[1977]], and the recording was completed on [[June 28]], [[1977]].<ref name="RSBook1">{{cite book | author=Adams, Douglas. | editor = Geoffrey Perkins (ed.), additional Material by M.

In fact, to win this latter argument, Hitchhiker's was briefly classified as a Drama instead of a Comedy, as Drama programmes were allowed to be recorded in stereo, and Comedy programmes were not, in 1977.

A full series of six episodes (five new episodes, plus the pilot) were commissioned on [[August 31]], [[1977]].<ref name="RSBook1" /> However, Adams had in the meantime sent a copy of the Hitchhiker's pilot episode to the BBC's [[Doctor Who]] production office, and was thus commissioned to write a four part Doctor Who serial ([[The Pirate Planet]]) a few weeks later. In addition, Simon Brett had departed the BBC, and the final five episodes in the first series were produced by [[Geoffrey Perkins]].

With conflicting writing commitments, Adams brought his friend [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]] in for writing assistance on what became known as "Fit the Fifth" and "Fit the Sixth." Aside from the later Infocom computer game, (and, arguably, the movie screenplay), this is the only instance of any form of Hitchhiker's having a co-writer credit.  Production of the second episode was done in November, 1977. The script of the last episode of the first series (later retitled "The Primary Phase") was completed in February 1978, and production (including sound mixing and effects) was completed on [[March 3]], [[1978]].

==First and second radio series==

{{main|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases}}

The first radio series (first six episodes) were broadcast in March and April, 1978. A seventh episode was broadcast on [[December 24]], [[1978]]. This seventh episode was commonly known as the [[Christmas]] Episode. This had nothing to do with Christmas except in an early draft (which would have had [[Marvin the Paranoid Android]] revealed as the "star" followed by the [[Three Wise Men]]);<ref> Adams. Perkins (ed.) Additional material by M.J. Simpson. Page 147.</ref> it was called the Christmas Episode because it was first broadcast on [[Christmas Eve]]. The final five episodes, completing the second radio series, were broadcast in January 1980.

Production on the second series was delayed multiple times. While Adams was meant to be working on scripts for a stage adaptation of ''Hitchhiker's'' in April 1979, he was also employed as the Script Editor for ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and turned down an offer from John Lloyd to submit material for ''[[Not the Nine O'Clock News]]''. In fact, the recording on the first day scheduled for the second radio series, 19 May 1979, was left incomplete as Adams had not finished the script. Further scheduled recordings on 11 July and 1 August of that year were also canceled, this time due in part with Adams trying to work on the LP re-recordings of the first series, as well as its novelization. Further recording attempts were made on 23 October and 3 December.<ref>{{cite journal |author=[[Andrew Pixley|Pixley, Andrew]] |year=2004 |month=October |title=One Step Beyond |journal=Doctor Who Magazine: Special Edition |issue=#9: The Complete Fourth Doctor Volume Two |pages=Pages 29-34 |id={{ISSN|0963-1275}} }}</ref> Recording of the final episode in the second series was completed on 13 January 1980, though the audio mixing of the episode was finished on 25 January, the day it was transmitted. The tape "arrived just a few minutes before transmission."<ref>Adams. Perkins (ed.) Additional material by M.J. Simpson. Page 246</ref>

All of the episodes, including those completed after Adams's death, are referred to as 'Fits,' after [[Lewis Carroll]]'s "[[The Hunting of the Snark]]: an Agony, in Eight Fits". In 1981, upon a rebroadcast of the twelve episodes of the first two series, it was decided that the Christmas episode, which previously had no episode number, would be called "Fit the Seventh" and the episodes in the second series, which had first been billed as Fit the First through Fit the Fifth (representing five parts of the second series) would become Fit the Eighth through Fit the Twelfth.<ref>Adams. Perkins (ed.) Additional material by M.J. Simpson. Page 253</ref>

The two series were first released on audio cassette and CD in 1988, marking the tenth anniversary of the first broadcast of the first episode. It was the first time that the BBC Radio Collection division of BBC Enterprises had ever released a radio series on CD. The two radio series were known simply as "the first series" and "the second series" until 1992 when the BBC made its first re-release in separate boxes as "The Primary Phase" and "The Secondary Phase." The episodes were released with those titles in 1993, and again in 1998, for the series' twentieth anniversary.

There were many other staff members of the BBC who worked on the first two radio series. Sound and effects for the [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop]] were by [[Paddy Kingsland]], [[Dick Mills]] and Harry Parker. The Chief Sound Engineer was Alick Hale-Munro, and Anne Ling was the production secretary. The "Technical Team" is given as: Paul Hawdon, Lisa Braun (studio manager), Colin Duff (studio manager), Eric Young, Martha Knight, Max Alcock and John Whitehall.<ref>Webb, pages 329-330.</ref> Several of the sound effects recorded by Dick Mills for the first series were released on the album ''[[BBC Sound Effects No. 26 - Sci-Fi Sound Effects]]''.

The twelve original radio episodes have been translated and transmitted in Finland, France, The Netherlands and Sweden. A German radio version of the first six radio episodes was transmitted in 1981. For full details, see [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy as international phenomenon]].

==Radio series three, four and five==
{{main|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases}}

In November 2003, two years after Adams's death and 23 years after the production on the Secondary Phase had ceased, a new radio adaptation of ''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]'' was announced. This would become the third series of the ''Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' on radio. At the time of the announcement, it was stated that the original goal was to transmit the six part adaptation of the third novel starting in February 2004, with the remaining eight episodes comprising the final two novels to be transmitted in September 2004.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Dominic May, editor | year = 2003 | month = November | title = The TV Zone News: The Guide, Part Three | journal = TV Zone | issue = 170 | pages = Page 10 | id = {{ISSN|0957-3844}} }}</ref> However, after the six episodes comprising the third series had been recorded by [[Above the Title Productions]], a minor legal dispute erupted between the production company and [[Walt Disney Productions]], which had started production on the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|''Hitchhiker's'' movie]], also in 2003. This led to a delay in transmitting the third series, which was reported in May 2004. The same report mentioned that the dispute also caused an immediate cessation in the production of series four and five.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Steve O'Brien, editor | year = 2004 | month = May | title = Strange Tales: New Hitchhiker's Postponed | journal = SFX | issue = 117 | pages = Page 16 }}</ref> Much later, it was revealed that the dispute centered over the online availability of the Tertiary Phase and its sequels.<ref>Webb, page 324.</ref> Eventually a deal was worked out, and the Tertiary Phase began broadcasting on [[BBC Radio 4]] on [[September 21]], [[2004]]. 

These new episodes reunited most of the living original cast. The parts of The Book, [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Eddie|Eddie the Computer]] and [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Slartibartfast|Slartibartfast]] were recast, with [[William Franklyn]], Roger Gregg and [[Richard Griffiths]] taking over these three roles, respectively. [[Peter Jones]], the original narrator, had died in 2000; [[Richard Vernon]], the original Slartibartfast, had died in 1997; and David Tate, who had voiced Eddie the Computer (among many other roles), had died in 1996.<ref>Adams. Maggs, (ed.), pages viii-x.</ref> Bill Wallis, who played [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Mr Prosser|Mr. Prosser]] and [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz|Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz]] in the original series, was unavailable, and [[Toby Longworth]] took the role of Jeltz in the new series. [[John Marsh]], who had been the continuity announcer for Fits Two through Twelve, was rehired to reprise this role.<ref>Ibid. Page 23.</ref> In another continuity nod, the term 'Fit' is still used in place of 'episode.'

Each episode was broadcast on a Tuesday afternoon, repeated on a Thursday evening, and [[streaming media|audio streams]] in [[RealPlayer]] and [[Windows Media]] formats (including versions in a [[Surround Sound|5.1 surround mix]]) were made available on Radio 4's website until the following Thursday. A 3-CD set of the Tertiary Phase was released in mid-October 2004, before the final episodes were broadcast. These CDs contain extended material, previously cut to make 27-minute episodes for radio.

This production, as well as adaptations for books four and five, were adapted, directed, and co-produced by [[Dirk Maggs]]. Maggs had previously consulted with Adams on potential radio adaptations for the final three books in 1993 and 1997. The project was re-started in September 2001 by Maggs, Helen Chattwell and Bruce Hyman, with help from Jane Belson and Ed Victor.

The six-part "Tertiary Phase" was broadcast in September and October of 2004. The four-part "Quandary Phase" was broadcast in May 2005, and the four-part "Quintessential Phase" was broadcast immediately following, in May and June of 2005.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/hitchhikers/newseries.shtml Episode Synopses], including original broadcast dates and times, on the BBC Radio 4 ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' page.</ref> A 2-CD set of the Quandary Phase was released at the end of May 2005, and a 2-CD set of the Quintessential Phase was released at the end of June 2005. Both sets again include material that was originally cut for reasons of timing.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/hitchhikers/webchat3.shtml Web chat] with [[Dirk Maggs]] from 22 June 2005, which discussed the material cut for broadcast but included on cassette and CD releases.</ref>

Maggs stated in the new script book that he felt bound by his promise to Douglas Adams to allow the scripts of the Tertiary Phase to closely follow the plot of the third book. He further said, "I myself was willing to give the Tertiary Phase 7 out of 10 on the grounds that I was a little too reverential to the text and the pace suffered as a result."<ref name="RSBook2">Adams. Maggs, (ed.), page 149.</ref> But in adapting the final two novels, the only instructions Maggs got from Adams was "They don't need more than four episodes each."<ref name="RSBook2" /> Thus Maggs was able to use many of the major plot elements of the final two books (though not necessarily in the same order), and attempt to reconnect plot threads from all five radio series.

==After the fifth series==
A script book for the final fourteen episodes was released in July 2005. The book is entitled ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Radio Scripts: The Tertiary, Quandary and Quintessential Phases.'' Dirk Maggs writes in his introduction that the "book is a companion volume to ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: The Original Radio Scripts|The Original Radio Scripts]]''...."<ref>Ibid., page xv.</ref>

A box set entitled ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: The Complete Radio Series'' was released on [[October 3]], [[2005]].<ref> [http://www.bbcshop.com/invt/0563504196&bklist=%3Cvenda_bklist1%3E BBC Shop] page for "The Complete Radio Series" set, including release date.</ref> It contains fifteen CDs, subdivided per radio series, and bonus material exclusive to the box set. BBC Audio released a DVD version of the ''Tertiary Phase'', featuring that series in 5.1 surround sound, in October 2006.<ref>[http://www.bbcshop.com/invt/0563504579&bklist=%3Cvenda_bklist1%3E BBC Shop] page for the ''Tertiary Phase'' DVD.</ref> Contrary to previous announcements, this was merely a [[DVD-Video]] disc with Dolby Digital sound and other features, rather than a [[DVD-Audio]] disc. While it had been stated that BBC Audio plans on also releasing the fourth and fifth radio series on DVD, no dates have been set.

== Music used in the series ==
One of Adams's stated goals was to be experimental in the use of sound,<ref>Adams. Perkins (ed.) Additional material by M.J. Simpson. Page 12</ref> thus the use of stereo sound (which he later said that before Hitchhiker's it was deemed impossible and after Hitchhiker's it was made compulsory in radio comedy). Being a fan of [[Pink Floyd]] and the [[Beatles]] (and especially the experimental albums both bands produced in the late 1960s and early 1970s) Adams also wanted to incorporate other bits of music from a variety of artists. This was only achieved during the first series. There were, naturally, some problems with copyrights (see "Musical copyrights" below, for more). During the second series, [[Paddy Kingsland]] was commissioned to provide background music, and in the third through fifth series, that role has been given to [[Paul Wickens|Paul 'Wix' Wickens]]. 

For the CD and cassette releases of the Tertiary Phase in the United States, and all CD and cassette releases of the Quandary and Quintessential Phases, the instrumental title theme, ''Journey of the Sorcerer,'' composed by [[Bernie Leadon]] and originally recorded by US rock band [[The Eagles]], was re-interpreted by The Illegal Eagles, a [[tribute band]], using an arrangement by [[Philip Pope]]. This was done due to licensing reasons (though the original track was used for the original radio transmissions and the on-demand downloads). <ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/hitchhikers/diary.shtml BBC Radio 4 Hitchhiker's Production Diary] entry by Dirk Maggs.

===Musical copyrights===
A scene from Fit the Third in which the characters step out onto [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Magrathea|Magrathea]] was cut from commercially released recordings of the radio series, because it featured copyrighted music. The character of [[Marvin the Paranoid Android|Marvin]] "hums" like [[Pink Floyd]], using the opening to "[[Shine on You Crazy Diamond]]", then "sings" "[[Rock and Roll Music]]" by the [[Beatles]], and finally the theme music from ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', the opening "Sunrise" movement from [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Also sprach Zarathustra]]''. It would have been very cost prohibitive in the 1980s to get clearances to release a recording of Fit the Third with this music, though agreements were reached on most of the rest of the copyrighted music used during the first series. As a result, all commercial recordings of Fit the Third are about two minutes shorter than other episodes. Recordings of the original radio broadcasts still contain it.<ref> [http://www.jwhitham.org.uk/magrathea/ Website] with a digital version of an original, off-air recording of "Fit the Third", which contains the scene deleted from all commercial releases, due to musical copyrights. Accessed 9 August 2006.</ref>

A variation of this scene was re-recorded for the LP, using music that "sounds" like Pink Floyd without actually being taken from any of their albums. This made Arthur's line "Do you realize that robot can hum like Pink Floyd?" literally true. The next bit, about the Beatles, is left out, but as Zaphod is announcing that he discovered a way into Magrathea, the "Zarathustra" introduction/theme is played again (using a synthesizer).

==Sequences inspired by real events==
One sequence that occurs only in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#The Secondary Phase|The Secondary Phase]] is a plot revolving around shoes and the "[[Shoe Event Horizon]]." This is mainly cut down in [[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe|the second novel]], but was based on Adams's own problems in trying to find a pair of shoes.<ref>Adams. Perkins (ed.) Additional material by M.J. Simpson. Page 227.</ref>

Another episode trying to catch a plane from London to Leeds, delayed because in-flight snacks (first a bar, and then coffee and biscuits) had not been delivered, similarly inspired the story of the space liner delayed for 900 years because it lacked a supply of "lemon soaked paper napkins". Adams stated that he could have taken the train, but had hoped to save some time by flying. As the flight in question arrived half an hour late, he lost that advantage.<ref>Ibid. Page 247.</ref>

==Rebroadcasts and recordings==
The complete first series was rebroadcast twice in 1978, and once in 1979. The complete second series was rebroadcast once in 1980, and the complete original run of 12 episodes was broadcast twice over a twelve-week period, once from April to June, 1981 and the second time from the end of March to the start of June, 1983.<ref>Ibid. Page 252.</ref>

In 1988, the first two radio series were the first programmes of any kind released on CD by the [[BBC Radio Collection]].<ref name="Pocket">{{cite book | author=Simpson, M. J. | title=The Pocket Essential Hitchhiker's Guide | edition =Second Edition | publisher=Pocket Essentials | year=2005 | id=ISBN 1-904048-46-3 |pages=Page 83}}</ref> In 2001, they became the first programmes of any kind re-released by the BBC Radio Collection in an MP3-CD format.<ref name="Pocket" />

==Awards==

[[Image:Hyperland-agent.jpg|thumb|Tom Baker plays a "software agent," whose appearance can be manipulated by Douglas Adams. Here, Adams (temporarily) configures Tom to look like a stereotypical [[Neanderthal]].]]

'''''Hyperland''''' is a 50 minute long [[documentary film]] about [[hypertext]] and surrounding technologies written by [[Douglas Adams]] and produced by [[BBC Two]] in [[1990]]. It stars [[Douglas Adams]] as a computer user and [[Tom Baker]], with whom Adams already had worked on ''[[Doctor Who]]'', as a software agent. 

== Content ==

The self proclaimed "fantasy documentary" begins with a shot of [[Douglas Adams]] asleep by the fire side with his television still running. In a dream Adams, fed up by game shows, commercial and generally non-interactive linear content, takes his TV to a garbage dump, where he meets Tom, played by [[Tom Baker]], a [[software agent]] that shows him the future of TV: Interactive Multimedia.

Much like [[Apple Computer]]'s [[Knowledge Navigator]] concept, Tom acts as a butler within a virtual space populated with hypertext, sound, pictures and movies  represented by animated icons. The documentary is centered on Adams browsing these media and discovering their [[interconnectedness]], leading him for example from the topic ''[[Atlantic Ocean]]'' to ''literature about the sea'' to ''Rime of the Ancient Mariner'' by [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] to the poem ''[[Kubla Khan]]'' by the same author to ''[[Xanadu]]'' and back to the topic of [[hypertext]] via [[Ted Nelson]]'s ''[[Project Xanadu]]''.

While Adams is browsing, many people and projects related to the general theme of [[hypertext]] and [[multimedia]] are presented:

* [[Vannevar Bush]] and his [[Memex]] concept of a theoretical proto-hypertext computer system are shown
* [[Ted Nelson]] explains [[hypertext]] and [[Project Xanadu]]
* [[Hans Peter Brøndmo]] talks about the concept of animated icons
* [[Robert Winter]] talking about an interactive version of [[Beethoven]]'s 9th symphony
* The idea from the book [[Palm Sunday (book)|Palm Sunday]] by [[Kurt Vonnegut]]: Stories have shapes that can be drawn on graph paper.
* [[Robert Abel]] shows his multimedia version of [[Picasso]]'s ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]''
* [[Apple Multimedia Lab]] employees Steve Gano, Kristee Kreitman, Kristina Hooper, [[Michael Naimark]] and Fabrice Florin talk about a multimedial version of [[Life Story]], a BBC TV film dramatisation of the discovery of the structure of [[DNA]] in [[1953]].
* Amanda Goodenough presents ''Inigo Gets Out'', an interactive story for kids implemented with [[Hypercard]]
* [[Brad deGraf]] and [[Michael Wahrman]] talk about their [[Digital puppetry|digital puppet ''Mike Normal'']]
* A [[NASA Ames Research Center]] scientist presents a [[Virtual Reality]] Helmet prototype called ''Cyberiad''

The dream (and the documentary) ends with a vision of how information is accessed in [[2005]], that bears some resemblance to [[virtual reality]] scenes seen in the film ''[[The Lawnmower Man (1992 film)|The Lawnmower Man]]'' two years after Hyperland was produced. It can be argued that, apart from that graphical representation, the documentary draws a quite accurate vision of [[hypertext]] and how it is used today, especially considering that it predates the [[World Wide Web|first Web browser]].

== Trivia ==
* [[Marc Canter]] makes an appearance as an animated icon but isn't "clicked" by Adams, so the audience does not get to see his interview.
* Many aspects of the documentary show [[Douglas Adams]]'s love for Apple computers. In the beginning a [[Macintosh Portable]] can be spotted and most of the projects presented run on Apple Hardware. Even the general design of the animated icons featured in the dream is inspired by [[Mac OS]] icons.
* [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] and ''[[Kubla Khan]]'' are also featured prominently in [[Douglas Adams]]' novel ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]''.

[[Image:H2G2 Original Radio Scripts 25th front.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Front cover of the twenty-fifth anniversary UK trade paperback edition of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: The Original Radio Scripts'', 2003.]]

'''''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy: The Original Radio Scripts''''' is a book, published in [[1985]], containing the scripts for the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases|original radio series]] version of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' by [[Douglas Adams]]. Text present in the original scripts but cut to meet time constraints is printed in-line in italics. This book also includes explanatory footnotes, behind-the-scenes anecdotes, and forewords by Adams and by series producer [[Geoffrey Perkins]]. These facts tend to make this book better suited to serve as a primary reference for the cultural context and significance of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy cult than many of the other cult texts.

The book was reprinted in a tenth anniversary edition in [[1995]], and a twenty-fifth anniversary edition in [[2003]]. The twenty-fifth anniversary edition contains a new introduction by Geoffrey Perkins, and newly researched material by M. J. Simpson, including a transcript of ''The Lost Hitchhiker Sketch.'' The sketch was an interview with [[Simon Jones (actor)|Simon Jones]] in character as [[Arthur Dent]], conducted by [[Sheila Steafel]] on her show ''[[Steafel Plus]]'' in [[1982]], written entirely by Adams. The sketch can be heard in the ''[[Douglas Adams at the BBC]]'' CD collection. The book now contains transcripts of all Hitchhikers radio sketches, barring a sketch for Marvin that Adams wrote for the BBC Radio 1 show [[Studio B15]] to promote the television version of the serial, which was broadcast in 1982.

In the first edition a page of dialogue was omitted from [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#Fit the Twelfth|Fit the Twelfth]]. The 25th anniversary edition reprint does not repeat the omission.

There are many '''minor characters in the various versions of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''''', by [[Douglas Adams]].  In fact, defining a major character is rather difficult. If the major characters are those the plot focuses on, they are [[Arthur Dent]], [[Ford Prefect (character)|Ford Prefect]], [[Zaphod Beeblebrox]], [[Marvin the Paranoid Android|Marvin]], [[Trillian (character)|Trillian]] and [[Slartibartfast]] with the possible inclusion of [[#Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz|Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz]], [[#Random Dent|Random Dent]] and [[#Fenchurch|Fenchurch]]. If they are defined as characters appearing in all the books, they are only Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent. In this case, the definition of major characters will be those in the series with major plot significance not appearing on this list.

=Characters=

==Agrajag==
'''Agrajag''' is a piteous creature that is continually [[reincarnation|reincarnated]] and subsequently killed unknowingly by [[Arthur Dent]] each time. Agrajag first appears in the series as a falling bowl of [[petunia]]s, although he is not identified as being the petunias until a later book. In another incarnation, he was a prehistoric [[rabbit]] who was killed by Arthur for breakfast and whose skin was fashioned into a pouch, which is then used to swat a fly who also happened to be Agrajag. In yet another, he dies of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] after seeing Arthur and Ford materialize, seated on a Chesterfield sofa, in the midst of a [[cricket]] match at [[Lord's Cricket Ground]].

Eventually, Agrajag becomes aware of his many past incarnations and wishes to take revenge on Arthur Dent. He diverts Arthur's teleportation to the Cathedral of Hate for revenge, but mistakenly does so before the death of one of his incarnations has actually happened, thus making the attempt logically impossible. Agrajag tries to kill Arthur anyway, and once again dies at Arthur's hands, but not before setting off the explosives intended to kill Arthur in a massive rockfall.  Because of cause and effect and the laws of time and the universe (not to mention dramatic necessity), Arthur escapes the rockfall and goes on to witness the death of Agrajag that hadn't yet happened when he was diverted to the Cathedral of Hate. In ''[[Mostly Harmless]]'' Agrajag is shot and killed by Random Frequent Flyer Dent, Arthur's daughter, at the club Beta when she is startled by him.  Agrajag believed the shot was aimed at Arthur and Arthur's ducking constituted that Arthur had once again killed Agrajag, in Agrajag's point of view.

In the [[2004]]/[[2005]] [[BBC Radio]] series versions of the last three books of Adams' series, Douglas Adams plays Agrajag, having recorded the part for an audiobook version of ''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]''. Producer [[Dirk Maggs]] added a suitable voice treatment, and [[Simon Jones (actor)|Simon Jones]] as Arthur Dent recorded his lines opposite the pre-recorded Adams.  Adams was thus able to "reincarnate" to participate in the new series.

Appears in:

*''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (book)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' (named only as "bowl of petunias")
*''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]''
*''[[Mostly Harmless]]''

==Alice Beeblebrox, Mrs==
Alice Beeblebrox is Zaphod's favourite mother, and guards the true story of Zaphod's visit to the Frogstar, waiting for "the right price." She is referenced in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#Fit the Eighth|Fit the Eighth]].

==Allitnils, The==
As their names were written to suggest, every '''Allitnil''' is an anti-clone of a [[#Lintilla|Lintilla]]. They were created by the cloning company to eliminate the billions of cloned Lintillas flooding out of a malfunctioning cloning machine. Being anti-clones, when an Allitnil comes into physical contact with a Lintilla, they both wink out of existence in a puff of unsmoke.

Along with Poodoo and Varntvar the Priest, three Allitnils arrived on Brontitall to get the three Lintillas there to "agree to cease to be". Two of the clones eliminate their corresponding Lintillas, but Arthur shoots the third Allitnil, so that one Lintilla survives.

Appearing only in the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#Fit the Twelfth|final episode of the second radio series]], every one of the Allitnils are voiced by David Tate.

==Almighty Bob==
The '''Almighty Bob''' is a [[deity]] worshipped by the people of [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Lamuella|Lamuella]]. [[#Old Thrashbarg|Old Thrashbarg]] is one of the priests who worships Almighty Bob; however, Thrashbarg is often ignored by the villagers of [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Lamuella|Lamuella]].

==Anjie==
'''Anjie''' was a woman, on the brink of retirement, and on whose behalf a raffle was being held in order to buy her a kidney machine. An unnamed woman convinces Arthur Dent to buy raffle tickets while he and Fenchurch are in a railway pub, attempting to have lunch. Arthur won an album of bagpipe music.

Referred to in: ''[[So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish]]''

==Arcane Jill Watson==
Wife of John Watson, aka Wonko the Sane. Appears in ''So Long, and Thanks for all the Fish.''  '''Arcane Jill Watson''' tells Arthur on the phone the number of light years her husband is from the phone, and invites Arthur and Fenchurch to California. Also, Arcane is known to be the one who fills John Watson's fish bowl (A parting gift from the dolphins) with [[wheat germ]], and when it was empty at the time of Arthur and Fenchurch's visit, going to buy some more [[wheat germ]] to fill it.

==Arcturan Megafreighter crew==
The captain and first officer were the only '''crew of an Arcturan Megafreighter''' carrying a larger number of copies of ''Playbeing'' magazine than the mind can comfortably conceive.  They brought Zaphod Beeblebrox to Ursa Minor Beta, after he had escaped from the Haggunenon flag ship.  Zaphod was let on board by the Number One, who was cynical about the Guide's editors becoming soft.  He admired the fact that Zaphod was ''"hitching the hard way"''.

They only appear in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#Fit the Seventh|Fit the Seventh]] of the radio series, where the captain is played by [[David Tate]], and his number one by [[Bill Paterson]].  However, some of their dialogue was given to other characters in ''[[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe]]''.

==Barmen==
Three different '''barmen''' appear during the series.
===Barman of the Horse and Groom===
In the first book, in the TV series and the film, Ford and Arthur quickly down three pints - at lunchtime - to calm their muscles before using the teleport to escape on the Vogon ship.  Being told the world is about to end he calls "last orders, please." The Red Lion Inn was used during the TV series (Adams himself can be seen in the background of this scene). This barman was played by [[David Gooderson]] in the original radio series and [[Stephen Moore (actor)|Stephen Moore]] in the LP recording. In the 2005 motion picture, [[Albie Woodington]] portrayed this particular barman.

===Barman in Old Pink Dog Bar===
Ford visits the Old Pink Dog Bar in Han Dold City, orders a round for everyone and then tries to use an American Express card to pay for it, fails, is threatened by a disembodied hand and so offers a Guide write-up instead.  This happens in ''[[So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish]]''. In the radio adaptation of this novel, the barman was played by Arthur Smith.

===Barman in the Domain of the King===
Another barman takes a galactic size tip for Elvis from Ford on his Hitchhiker's corporate Dine-O-Charge credit card in an attempt to bankrupt InfiniDim Enterprises in ''[[Mostly Harmless]]'' and the final radio series. This bartender was played by Roger Gregg.

==BBC department head==
When Arthur returns to the Earth in [[So Long and Thanks for All the Fish]] he calls his department head to explain why he was AWOL from work the last six months: "I've gone mad.".  His superior is very relaxed about it and asks when Arthur will return to work, and is quite satisfied by the reply "When do hedgehogs stop hibernating?".  In the recent radio series, the part is played by [[Geoffrey Perkins]].

==Blart Versenwald III==
In the epilogue of ''So Long and Thanks for All the Fish'', '''Blart Versenwald III''' was a top genetic engineer, and a man who could never keep his mind on the job at hand. When his homeworld was under threat from an invading army, he was tasked with creating an army of super-soldiers to fight them. Instead, he created (among other things) an off-switch for children and a remarkable new breed of superfly that could distinguish between solid glass and an open window. Fortunately, because the invaders were only invading because they couldn't cope with things back home, they too were impressed with Blart's creations, and a flurry of economic treaties rapidly secured peace.

There is apparently a relevance of this tale to So Long and Thanks for All The Fish, but it temporarily escaped the author's mind.

==Bodyguard==
The strong silent type, an unnamed '''bodyguard''' is seen guarding the late [[#Hotblack Desiato|Hotblack Desiato]] in ''[[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe]]'', the LP adaptation of the radio series. In [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)#Episode Five|Episode Five]] of the TV series he is portrayed as a man of few words but who can lift [[Ford Prefect (character)|Ford Prefect]] clean off the floor by actor [[David Prowse]], [[Star Wars]]' [[Darth Vader]].  In the LP adaptation of the radio series, the character was voiced by David Tate.

==Caveman==
[[Image:HH caveman.jpg|100px|right]]Not even able to spell "Grunt" and "Agh" and in consequence not make a suitable opponent at [[Scrabble]] for Arthur Dent ("he's probably spelt library with one R"). The '''caveman''' points at his spelling of "FORTY TWO" the game board gives Arthur the idea to pull out letters from the letters bag at random to attempt to find the ultimate question.  Either the Vogons destroying the Earth five minutes too early, or the [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Golgafrincham|Golgafrinchan]]'s interference results in Arthur's brainwave patterns providing the unhelpful "What do you get when you multiply six by nine?".

Appears in Fit the Sixth, the novel ''[[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe]]'', and TV [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)#Episode Six|Episode Six]].

==Colin==
'''Colin''' is a small, round, melon-sized, flying security robot which [[Ford Prefect (character)|Ford Prefect]] enslaves to aid in his escape from the newly re-organized [[Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|Guide]] offices in ''[[Mostly Harmless]]''. Ford captures Colin by trapping the robot with his [[towel]] and re-wiring the robot's pleasure circuits, inducing a cyber-ecstasy trip.

Ford uses Colin's cheerfulness to break into the Guide's corporate accounting software in order to plant a [[Trojan Horse]] module that will automatically pay anything billed to his  InfiniDim Enterprises credit card. Colin also saves Ford's life when the Guide's new security force, the [[Vogons]] fire at him with a [[Shoulder-launched missile weapon|rocket launcher]] after Ford feels the need to jump out of the window.  Colin was last seen being sent (at the risk of possible lonely incineration) to look after the delivery of the Guide Mark II to Arthur Dent in the Vogon's postal system.

Colin was named after a dog belonging to a girl Ford had "fond memories" of: Emily Saunders.  Colin appears in ''[[Mostly Harmless]]'' and in the radio series he was played by [[Andrew Secombe]].

==Dr. Dan Streetmentioner==
Author of ''Time Traveller's Handbook of 1001 Tense Formations'' which is handy for those travelling through time, and especially to [[Milliways]]. His guide is more complete than ''The Guide'' itself, which ignores the time travel tense topic – other than pointing out that the term 'future perfect' has been abandoned since it was discovered not to be. He is also mentioned in the third radio series, which gives many examples of his tense forms.

==Deep Thought==
[[Image:Deep Thought, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.jpg|frame|thumb|Deep Thought, from concept art for [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|the motion picture adaptation]] of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.'']]
'''Deep Thought''' is a computer that was created by a pan-dimensional, hyper-intelligent race of beings to come up with [[Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything|the ultimate answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything]]. When, after seven and a half million years of calculation, the answer finally turns out to be [[42 (number)|42]], Deep Thought's creators sheepishly realize that they do not know the question from whence the ultimate answer turned out to be.

Deep Thought itself does not know the ultimate question to Life, the Universe and Everything, but offers to design an even more powerful computer ([[Earth]]; see [[Earth in fiction#Hitchhiker's Guide|Earth in fiction]]) to calculate it.  After ten million years of calculation, the Earth is destroyed by [[Vogon]]s five minutes before the computation is complete.

Appears in:

*''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (book)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''

On radio, Deep Thought was voiced by [[Geoffrey McGivern]]. On television and in the LP re-recording of the radio series, he was voiced by [[Valentine Dyall]]. In the feature film Deep Thought's voice was provided by actress [[Helen Mirren]].

In the television series, Deep Thought was shaped like a massive, black, and metal trapezoid with a yellow rectangular display that blinked on and off in time with the computer's speaking. The timing of the light's flashing was done on set by author [[Douglas Adams]]. Valentine Dyall's voice was dubbed in later.

In the feature film, it appears as a large, vaguely humanoid computer (see picture), with a gigantic head supported, as if in a bored repose, by two arms. This particular version of Deep Thought likes to watch [[television]] and late in the film can also be seen to have the [[Apple Computer]] logo above its eye. This is a reference to Adams being a fan and advocate of the [[Apple Macintosh]] until his death.

[[IBM]]'s [[chess]]-playing computer [[Deep Thought (chess computer)|Deep Thought]] was named in honour of this fictional computer.

The technology-related website Deep Thought[http://www.dtgeeks.com] was named after this fictional computer.

Regarding the naming of this character, all Douglas Adams was ever quoted as saying (in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s book ''[[Don't Panic: The Official Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Companion]]'') was that "The name is a very obvious joke."

==Disaster Area's chief research accountant==
[[Image:Disaster Area's chief research accountant.png|right|200px|Disaster Area's chief research accountant]]As Disaster Area's earnings require hypermathematics, their chief research [[accountant]] was named Professor of Neomathematics at the [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Maximegalon|University of Maximegalon]] and in his ''[[Special sciences|Special Theories]] of [[Tax return|Tax Returns]]'' he proves that [[spacetime|space-time]] is "not merely curved, it is, in fact, totally bent."

*''[[Restaurant at the End of the Universe]]''
*LP recording by the same title
*TV episode 5

==Dish of the Day==
[[Image:Dish of the Day from HHGG.jpg|right|200px|Not only Dish of the Day, but Doctor Who, Peter Davidson]]The quadruped '''Dish of the Day''' is an Ameglian Major Cow, a [[Ruminant]] specifically bred to not only have the desire to be eaten, but to be capable of saying so quite clearly and distinctly.  When asked if he would like to see the Dish of the Day, Zaphod replies: "let's meet the meat."  The Major Cow's quite vocal and emphatic desire to be consumed by [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Milliways|Milliways']] patrons greatly distresses Arthur Dent, and the Dish is nonplussed by a queasy Arthur's subsequent order of a [[green salad]], since he knows "many vegetables that are very clear" on the point of not wanting to be eaten &mdash; which was part of the reason for the creation of the Ameglian Major Cow in the first place.  After Zaphod orders four rare steaks, the Dish announces that he is nipping off to the kitchen to shoot himself. Though he states, "I'll be very humane," this does not comfort Arthur at all.

Appears in:

*''[[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe]]''

The character is not present in the original radio series, but does make a cameo appearance in the finale of the fifth radio series.  The first appearance of him was in a [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Stage Shows|stage adaptation]] in [[1980]] at the [[Rainbow Theatre]].  Since then he appeared in the second novel, and the [[Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)|television series]].  In the TV series, he was played by [[Peter Davison]], who was at that time both [[Sandra Dickinson]]'s husband and the newly announced fifth [[Doctor Who]].  Dickinson played Trillian in the television series (and "Tricia McMillan" in the final radio series), and suggested casting Davison, who was a fan of the radio series.

==East River Creature==
As [[Ford Prefect]] travels through space in a [[Sirius Cybernetics Corporation]] spaceship, he has a dream in which he encounters a strange creature made of slime from the East River in New York who has just come into existence. After asking Ford a series of question about life, and Ford's recommendation of finding love on 7th Avenue, the creature leaves Ford to talk to a nearby policemen on his status in life.

Appearances:
* ''[[So Long and Thanks for All the Fish]]''
* ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#Fit the Twenty-First|Fit the Twenty-First]]''

In Fit the Twenty-First, the East River character was played by [[Jackie Mason]]

==Eccentrica Gallumbits==
Known as "The Triple-Breasted Whore of Eroticon Six", '''Eccentrica Gallumbits''' is first mentioned in ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' when Arthur looks up ''Earth'' for the first time in the guide. The entry for Earth is under that of Eccentrica Gallumbits. She is heard about again during a newscast that [[Zaphod Beeblebrox]] tunes into shortly after stealing the spaceship ''[[Heart of Gold (spaceship)|Heart of Gold]]''. The newsreader quotes Eccentrica describing Zaphod as "The best bang since the [[Big Bang|Big One]]." It was also reported in Fit the Ninth of [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]] radio series that Zaphod had delivered a presidential address from her bedroom on at least one occasion.

Pears Gallumbit, a dessert which has several things in common with her, is available at [[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe]].

Some people say her [[erogenous zone]]s start some four miles from her actual body. Ford Prefect disagrees, saying five.

This character never actually appears in the series, but is mentioned by various characters in all five of the books.

In a possible homage to the series, the film ''[[Total Recall (film)|Total Recall]]'' features a triple-breasted prostitute (played by [[Lycia Naff]]); it also features a number of other references to the ''Guide'', such as wrapping a towel around one's head to avoid being found (synonymous with the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal).

She is referenced in an issue of the [[Legion of Super Heroes]].

==Eddie==
'''Eddie''' is the name of the shipboard computer on the starship ''[[Heart of Gold (spaceship)|Heart of Gold]]''. Like every other system on the spaceship, it has a [[Sirius Cybernetics Corporation]] Genuine People Personality. Thus, Eddie is over-excitable, quite talkative, over-enthused and extremely ingratiating, or alternatively a coddling, school matron-type after a particularly morose conversation with Marvin the paranoid android.  Shipboard networking interconnects Eddie with everything from the air conditioning upwards on the ''Heart of Gold'', with the downside the whole ship is effectively crippled by Arthur Dent's request for [[tea]] from [[Nutrimatic Drink Dispenser]], the computation of which nearly crashed Eddie and everything connected to him.

On some occasions when certain destruction seems quite imminent, Eddie will sing "[[You'll Never Walk Alone (song)|You'll Never Walk Alone]]" in a particularly cheesy and upbeat tone.

Appears in:

*''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (book)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''
*''[[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe]]''
*''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]''
*[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (computer game)|''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' (computer game)]]

He is voiced in the first two radio series and on television by [[David Tate]]. In the television version, Eddie has lights on his case that flash when he speaks. [[Douglas Adams]] read in Eddie's lines during filming to operate the lights.

In the 2004-2005 radio series, he is voiced by [[Roger Gregg]] and in the 2005 feature film by [[Thomas Lennon]].

==Effrafax of Wug==
A sciento-magician who bet his life that he could make an entire mountain invisible within a year. Having wasted most of the period of time failing to create a cloaking device, he hired a company to simply remove the mountain, though this course of action lost him the bet, and his life, due in part to the sudden and rather suspicious presence of an extra moon. It is remarked that he should have simply established a simple Somebody Else's Problem field, thus making the mountain totally invisible, by simply painting it bright pink.

Referenced in: ''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]''.

==Elders of Krikkit==
The '''Elders of Krikkit''' were, in [[Life, the Universe and Everything]], under influence of the remains of the supercomputer Hactar, which aeons previously had been blown to dust, but retained a measure of consciousness, and determined to destroy the entire universe using the supernova bomb they had built. Trillian used her feminine charm and smart rhetoric in an attempt to dissuade the elders, but failed to stop them deploying the ultimate weapon, which simply dented the council chamber, very badly.

==Elvis Presley==
[[Elvis Presley]] is a real-life singer, who died in [[1977]]. It has been popularly suggested that he has been [[alien abduction|abducted by aliens]], or that he is actually an alien who faked his own death so he could return to his home planet.

In the book ''[[Mostly Harmless]]'', Elvis is discovered by [[Ford Prefect]] and [[Arthur Dent]] working as a bar singer on an alien planet, and owning a large pink spaceship. Ford, having become huge fan of Elvis while he was stranded on Earth, watched the performance intently for its entire duration, despite his and Arthur's pressing need to leave Lamuella. Presley is not actually named, however his identity is easy to determine from the facts that the bar is called "The Domain of The King," the "EP" initials in the pink spaceship which Ford and Arthur buy from him, and the songs he sings in the bar.

Ford's irreplacable blue suede shoes, one of which is destroyed during the events in the early part of ''Mostly Harmless'' are a tribute to his Elvis fandom.

In the radio adaptation of ''Mostly Harmless'', [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Quintessential Phase|The Quintessential Phase]], it has been indicated that in the alternate Earth which is the focus of the story, Elvis never died, and there is mention of an album "Elvis sings [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]]".  He appears (but is not directly named) in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#Fit the Twenty-Sixth|Fit the Twenty-Sixth]], voiced by [[Philip Pope]].

==Emperor of the Galaxy==  	 
The final Emperor of the [[Galactic Empire (Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)|Galactic Empire]] in the ''Hitchhiker's'' universe was placed into a stasis field within his dying moments many millennia prior to the events of the series. This left the Empire without a ruling Emperor, as the last of the Emperor's heirs all died. And so an Imperial President, elected by the Galactic Assembly, was later seen to hold power, without actually wielding any. This was the office held by [[#Yooden Vranx|Yooden Vranx]] and [[Zaphod Beeblebrox]].

==Eric Bartlett==
In the final novel, it is gardener '''Eric Bartlett''' who discovers that space-aliens have landed on Tricia's lawn and hasn't cut her grass.

==Fenchurch==
[[Image:Fenchurch from TV Series.jpg|200px|right|"This time it was right, it would work, and no one would have to get nailed to anything"]]'''Fenchurch''' is [[Arthur Dent]]'s [[soulmate]] in the fourth book of the Hitchhiker "trilogy", ''[[So Long, and Thanks For All the Fish]]''.  Fenchurch was named after the [[Fenchurch Street railway station]] where she was conceived in the ticket queue. Adams revealed in an interview that it was really the ticket queues at Paddington Station that made him think of conceiving a character there, but chose Fenchurch as a name because of [[Paddington Bear]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Gaiman |first=Neil |authorlink=Neil Gaiman |coauthors=David K. Dickson and MJ Simpson |title=Don't Panic: Douglas Adams & The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy |edition=Third Edition |year=2003 |publisher=Titan Books |id=ISBN 1-84023-742-2 |pages=Pages 218-219 }}</ref>

She first appears as the unnamed girl in the café on the first page of the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (book)|first book]]; she is the girl referred to as "sitting on her own in a café in [[Rickmansworth]]." In the fourth book, when the Earth and everyone including Fenchurch had mysteriously reappeared, a romantic relationship blooms between her and Arthur Dent. He teaches her to fly, before a first aerial sexual encounter, and a second with [[Sony]] [[Walkman|Walkmen]].

At the beginning of the fifth book, she vanishes abruptly during a hyperspace jump on their first intergalactic holiday. [[Douglas Adams]] later claimed that he wanted to get rid of the character as she was getting in the way of the story. Much of this is evident from the [[self-reference|self-referential]] prose surrounding Arthur and Fenchurch's relationship.

In the Quintessential Phase of the radio series, she is revealed to have been working as a waitress at [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Milliways|Milliways]] since she vanished, and is reunited with [[Arthur Dent]].

In the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary through Quintessential Phases#The Quandary Phase|radio adaptation of So Long and Thanks For All the Fish]] Fenchurch is played by actress [[Jane Horrocks]].

Appears in:

*''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (book)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' (unnamed cameo)
*''[[So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish]]''
*''[[Mostly Harmless]]'' (only mentioned in passing)

==Frankie and Benjy mouse==
'''Frankie''' and '''Benjy''' are the mice that Arthur (et al.) encounter on [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Magrathea|Magrathea]].  Frankie and Benjy wish to extract the final readout data from Arthur's brain to get [[Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything|the Ultimate Question to Life, the Universe, and Everything]].  Frankie and Benjy are, after all, part of the pan-dimensional race that created the Earth as a [[supercomputer]] successor to [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Deep Thought|Deep Thought]] in order to find out the question to which the answer was [[42 (number)|42]].

In the first version, the radio series, they offered Arthur and Trillian a large amount of money if they could tell them what the Question is.  In later versions this was changed - unfortunately for Arthur, they claim the only way to do this is to remove his brain and prepare it, apparently by dicing it.  They promise to replace it with a simple computer brain, which, suggested Zaphod, would only have to say things like "What?", "I don't understand" and "Where's the tea?". Arthur objects to this ("What?", he says. "See!" says Zaphod), and escapes with the help of his friends.  Frankie says:

<blockquote>I mean, yes idealism, yes the dignity of pure research, yes, the pursuit of truth in all its forms, but there comes a point I'm afraid where you begin to suspect that if there's any real truth it's that the entire multi-dimensional infinity of the Universe is almost certainly being run by a bunch of maniacs; and if it comes to a choice between spending another ten million years finding that out and on the other hand just taking the money and running, I for one could do with the exercise<ref>{{cite book|author=Adams, Douglas|title=The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy The Original Radio Scripts|isbn=0330292889|page=83}}</ref></blockquote>

In the movie, they are in fact the manifestations of Lunkwill and Fook, the pan-dimensional beings who designed and built Deep Thought, and were squashed flat by Arthur Dent when they attempted to remove his brain.

Appear in:

*''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (book)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''

On radio, [[David Tate]] played Benjy Mouse and [[Peter Hawkins]] voiced Frankie Mouse.  They appeared in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#Fit the Fourth|Fit the Fourth]].  They also appeared in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)|Episode Four]] of the TV series, where they were voiced by David Tate and Stephen Moore.

==Frogstar Prisoner Relations Officer==
In [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#Fit the Eighth|Fit the Eighth]] the '''Frogstar Prisoner Relations Officer''' (referred to in the scripts as the "FPRO") does his best to annoy Zaphod by hosing him down, letting him think that he escaped to an Ursa Minor robot disco by body debit card, asking him for an autograph and teleporting away whilst Zaphod helps him with his respiratory problem - that he is breathing.

==Gag Halfrunt==
[[Image:Gag halfrunt.jpg|right|200px|"I think that this is perfectly normal behaviour for a psychiatrist"]]In the series, '''Gag Halfrunt''' is the private [[brain]] care specialist of [[Zaphod Beeblebrox]], and is not a major character in terms of the amount of dialogue or prominence he gets. However, he is major in the sense that he has a key influence on the plot (at least in the radio series version of HHGG). This may be in part because large parts of the series were made up by Adams as he went along, and some of the plot developments and explanations were more a way to tie up some of the glaring loose ends than part of a predetermined master plan.

In the story, the [[Earth]] is really a giant [[computer]] built to determine the Ultimate Question to Life, the Universe and Everything.  Gag Halfrunt (as leader of a group of psychiatrists) is in cahoots with the Vogons to destroy the Earth to prevent the Ultimate Question from ever being discovered.  The reason behind this plot is that the psychiatrists cannot afford to have the Ultimate Question revealed, because this would put them out of a job (on the premise that if the Question becomes known, everyone would suddenly start leading happy and productive lives, rendering the entire profession of [[psychiatry]] unnecessary). Later the Vogons also try (under Gag's direction) to destroy the starship ''[[Heart of Gold (spaceship)|Heart of Gold]]'', because it is carrying [[Arthur Dent]], who may have the Question buried in his brain somewhere. All of this is unknown to Zaphod because he has brainwashed himself to forget about the collusion (though again this seems to be more of a device to explain why it only becomes clear towards the end of the second series and hasn't been mentioned before). In the end Zaphod "remembers" and does, in fact, find [[#The Ruler of the Universe|The Ruler of the Universe]].

Gag Halfrunt was used since his first appearance in Fit the Second as a [[running joke]]; he would remark, in an oddly [[German language|German]] accent (possibly in reference to the Austrian psychiatrist [[Sigmund Freud]]), whenever asked about Zaphod "Vell, Zaphod's just zis guy, you know?" This line has become a popular catchphrase among fans of the series.

Appears in:

*''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''
*''[[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe]]''

On radio, he was voiced by [[Stephen Moore]], and appears in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#Fit the Second|Fits the Second]], 
[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#Fit the Seventh|Seventh]] and
[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#Fit the Ninth|Ninth]].

On television, he was played by [[Gil Morris]] and in the film he is played by [[Jason Schwartzman]].  In both these versions he only appears briefly, being interviewed about Zaphod Beeblebrox, and the plot involving the ruler of the Universe does not appear.

==Gail Andrews==
In ''[[Mostly Harmless]]'', Gail Andrews is an [[astrologer]] who is interviewed by [[Trillian (character)|Tricia McMillan]] about the impact that the discovery of the planet [[tenth planet|Persephone, or Rupert]] will have on astrology.  She is an advisor to the [[President of the United States]], President Hudson, but denies having recommended the bombing of [[Damascus]].

In the radio series, she appears in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#Fit the Twenty-Third|Fit the Twenty-Third]], and is voiced by [[Lorelei King]].

==Gargravarr==
'''Gargravarr''', the disembodied mind and custodian of the [[Total Perspective Vortex]] suffers from real-life [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]] and is therefore having trial separation with his body, which has taken his forename '''Pizpot'''. The dispute arose over whether sex is better than fishing or not, a disastrous attempt at combining the two activities, and his body going out partying too late.

Since he has no physical form that can be seen, he leads those condemned to the Total Perspective Vortex by humming various morose tunes so that the condemned can follow the sound of his voice.

Appears in:

*''[[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe]]''

Gargravarr was voiced on radio by [[Valentine Dyall]] - he appears in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#Fit the Eighth|Fit the Eighth]].

==Garkbit==
[[Image:Garkbit.jpg|150px|right|"If the lady and gentlemen would care to order drinks before dinner and the Universe will explode later for your pleasure."]]'''Garkbit''' is the Head Waiter at Milliways, the impossible "The Restaurant at the End of the Universe".  He is professionally unfazed by Arthur, Ford, Zaphod, and Trillian's unruly arrival, and has a fine sales-patter and very dry sense of humour.  

Appears in:

*''[[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe]]''

In the radio series Garkbit is played by [[Anthony Sharp]], and appears in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#Fit the Fifth|Fit the Fifth]]. In the television series, he is portrayed by [[Jack May]] and appears in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)#Episode Five|Episode Five]].

==[[Genghis Khan|Genghis Temüjin Khan]]==
Son of [[Yesugei|Yesügei]], Ghengis is both a distant ancestor of [[#Mr Prosser|Mr Prosser]] and was called "a wanker, a tosspot, a very tiny piece of turd" by [[#Wowbagger, the Infinitely Prolonged|Wowbagger, the Infinitely Prolonged]] in "The Private Life of Genghis Khan", originally based on a sketch written by Adams and [[Graham Chapman]]. The short story also appears in some editions of ''[[The Salmon of Doubt]]''.<ref>Adams, Douglas "The Utterly Utterly Merry Comic Relief Christmas Book", 1986</ref>.

==Great Green Arkleseizure==
To those on people of Viltvodle VI, the creator of the universe.  The Jatravartid's God appear in the second novel, the TV series, and the movie.

==God==
[[Image:God (Non-Existance of).jpg|200px|right|God, about to diappear in a puff of logic, from HitchHiker's TV series]]Aside from being the favourite subject of author [[#Oolon Colluphid|Oolon Colluphid]] ("Where God Went Wrong", "Some More of God's Greatest Mistakes", "Who is this God Person Anyway" and "That About Wraps it Up for God"), God also makes a disappearance in the Guide's entry for the Babel Fish ("I refuse to prove that I exist," says God, "for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing". "But," says man "The Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn't it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don't. [[Q.E.D.|QED]].").

[[#Majikthise and Vroomfondel|Majikthise]] worries about philosophers sitting up half the night arguing that there may or may not be a God if [[#Deep Thought|Deep Thought]] can give His phone number the next morning.   Arthur, Fenchurch and Marvin visit God's Final Message to His Creation ("we apologise for the inconvenience") in [[So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish]]. 

Four other characters have the status of a god: [[#Almighty Bob|Almighty Bob]], the [[#Great Green Arkleseizure|Great Green Arkleseizure]], [[#Thor|Thor]] and [[#Rob McKenna|Rob McKenna]].

==Gogrilla Mincefriend==
An enterprising chap who addressed the problem of [[elevators]] refusing to operate because they had been afforded a degree of [[prescience]] (to facilitate their operation by allowing them to be waiting for you before you've even decided you want to go up or down a floor) but consequently become terrified of the future, and so taken to hiding in basements. Mincefriend became very wealthy when he patented and successfully marketed a device he had seen in a history book: the [[staircase]].

==Golgafrinchans==
The [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Golgafrincham|Golgafrinchans]] first appear in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#Fit the Sixth|Fit the Sixth]] of the radio series.  In the novel series, their appearances are all in ''[[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe]]'' and in the television show, they appear in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)#Episode Six|Episode Six]].  In all formats, the story is essentially the same.  Following their adventures at Milliways, Arthur and Ford teleport onto an "Ark Ship" containing a number of Golgafrinchans. This particular group consists of the "[[middle class]]" who have common, middle-management types of occupations.  They were sent away from their planet under false pretenses by the ([[upper class]]) "thinkers" and ([[working class]]) "doers" of their society, who deemed them useless.  They were told that the entire society had to move to a new planet, with a variety of thin excuses, and that it was necessary for them to go first to prepare the new planet for their occupation.  However, it turns out that one of the middle-men was necessary for survival, and as a result, the rest of the Golgafrinchan society died off (see below).

===Agda and Mella===
'''Agda''' and '''Mella''' are [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Golgafrincham|Golgafrinchan]] girls that Arthur and Ford hit on. On Golgafrincham, Agda used to be a junior [[Human resources|personnel officer]] and Mella an [[art director]]. Agda is taller and slimmer and Mella shorter and round-faced. Mella and Arthur became a couple, as did Agda and Ford. In a way Mella was very relieved because she had been saved from a life of looking at moodily lit tubes of toothpaste. Agda died a few weeks later from a chain of events that Ford unknowingly started by throwing the Scrabble letter Q into a privet bush: it startled a rabbit, which ran away and was eaten by a fox, who choked on the rabbit and died, contaminating a stream that Agda drank from and became sick - it is said that the only moral one could possibly learn from these occurrences is not to throw the letter Q into a privet bush. Agda and Mella only appear in the novel.

===Captain===
'''The Captain''' is the captain of the Golgafrinchan Ark Fleet Ship B. He likes to bathe with his rubber duck (he spent practically the entire time he was captain of the B Ark and as much of his time on Earth, a total time of over three years, as has been documented in the bath) and has got a very relaxed attitude towards everything.  The Captain also has a fondness for "jynnan tonnyx," which is one of a nearly infinite version of the alcoholic drink [[gin and tonic]], which, according to the story, every civilised culture in the universe has developed independently, though the drink's name is always a variation on Earth's gin and tonic. His personality was based on Douglas Adams' habit of taking extraordinarily long [[bathing|baths]] as a method of [[procrastination]] to avoid writing.

He was voiced by [[David Jason]] in the radio series and by Frank Middlemass in the LP album adaptation. On television, it was [[Aubrey Morris]].

===Great Circling Poets of Arium===
These rock throwing poets can be seen in the ''Guide'' graphics in the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)|TV series]], heard about in the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#The Primary Phase|Primary Phase]] and read about in the [[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe|second novel]]. They are original inhabitants of Golgafrincham, one of whose descendants inspire the stories that caused the creation of the "'B' Ark" that Arthur and Ford find themselves on. The first part of their songs tell of how five princes with four horses from the City of Vassilian travel widely in distant lands, and the latter - and longer - part of the songs are about which of them is going to walk back.

===Hairdresser===
One of the Golgafrinchans on the prehistoric Earth, the '''hairdresser''' was put in charge of the fire development sub-committee.  They gave him a couple of sticks to rub together, but instead, he made them into a pair of scissors in the radio series, or curling tongs in the television and book series.

He was played by [[Aubrey Woods]] in the radio series, by Stephen Grief in the LP album adaptation, and by [[David Rowlands]] on television.

===Management consultant===
The Golgafrinchans' '''management consultant''' tried to arrange the meetings of the colonization committee along the lines of a traditional committee structure, complete with a chair and an agenda.  He was also in charge of fiscal policy, and decided to adopt the leaf as legal tender, making everyone immensely rich.  In order to solve the inflation problem this caused, he planned a major deforestation campaign to effectively revalue the leaf by burning down all the forests.

He was played by [[Jonathan Cecil]] in the radio series, by David Tate in the LP album adaptation, and by [[Jon Glover]] on television.

===Marketing girl===
Another Golgafrinchan on prehistoric Earth, the '''marketing girl''' assisted the hairdresser's fire development sub-committee in researching what consumers want from fire and how they relate to it and if they want it fitted nasally.  She also tried to invent the wheel, but had a little difficulty deciding what colour it should be.

She was played by [[Beth Porter]] both in the radio series and on television and by Loueen Willoughby in the LP album adaptation.

===Number One===
'''Number One''' is the First officer in the Golgafrinchan Ark Fleet Ship B. He is not very smart, having difficulty tying up his shoelaces, but is regarded by the captain as a nice chap. His only function to appear in the series is to offer Ford and Arthur drinks.

He was voiced by [[Jonathan Cecil]] in the radio series and by David Tate in the LP album adaptation. On television, the character was renamed '''Number Three''' and played by [[Geoffrey Beevers]].

===Number Two===
'''Number Two''' is a [[militaristic]] officer in the Golgafrinchan Ark Fleet Ship B. He captures Arthur and Ford and interrogates them. When they land on Earth, Number Two declares a war on another, uninhabited continent. He likes shouting a lot, and thinks the Captain is an idiot.

He is played by [[Aubrey Woods]] in the radio series and by Stephen Grief in the LP album adaptation.  On television, the character was divided into two different characters: Number Two played by [[David Neville]] on the planet Earth, and '''Number One''' played by [[Matthew Scurfield]] on the B Ark. 

===Telephone Sanitizer===
The '''telephone sanitizer''' is involved in the plot thread relating to the planet Golgafrincham in ''[[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe]]''. Ironically, after all the telephone sanitizers were sent away with the rest of the "useless" Golgafrinchans, the rest of the society died off from an infectious disease contracted from an unsanitized telephone.

==Grunthos the Flatulent==
'''Grunthos the Flatulent''' was the poetmaster of the Azgoths of Kria, writers of the second worst poetry in the universe, just between [[#Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings|Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings]] and the [[Races and Species in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Vogons|Vogons]].

The guide recites a tale of how, during a reading of his poem ''Ode To A Small Lump Of Green Putty I Found In My Armpit One Midsummer Morning'', "four of the audience died of internal hemorrhaging and the president of the Mid-Galactic Arts Nobbling Council survived only by gnawing one of his own legs off."

Reportedly "disappointed" by the reception of his poem, Grunthos then prepared to read his 12-book epic, ''My Favourite Bathtime Gurgles'' (or ''Zen And The Art Of Going To The Lavatory'' in the TV series). He was prevented from doing so when his small intestine leapt up his neck and throttled his brain in a desperate bid to save civilization, killing him.

Excerpt from "''Ode To A Small Lump Of Green Putty I Found In My Armpit One Midsummer Morning''", taken from the TV series graphics:

:''Putty. Putty. Putty.''
:''Green Putty - Grutty Peen.''
:''Grarmpitutty - Morning!''
:''Pridsummer - Grorning Utty!''
:''Discovery..... Oh.''
:''Putty?..... Armpit?''
:''Armpit..... Putty.''
:''Not even a particularly''
:''Nice shade of green.''

Excerpt from "''Zen And The Art Of Going To The Lavatory''", also taken from the TV series

:''Move with the wind.''
:''Apologise where necessary.''

Appears in:

*''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''

==Hactar==
Flexible and imaginative, '''Hactar''' was the first [[computer]] in which its individual components reflected the pattern of the whole, much like [[DNA]] in a biological organism. (See [[Jupiter Brain]].) Hactar is made by the [[Races and Species in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Silastic Armourfiends of Striterax|Silastic Armourfiends]], who ask for an "Ultimate Weapon". Hactar, taking the request literally, builds a supernova bomb which would connect every major [[sun]] in the [[universe]] through hyperspace, thus making every [[star]] to go [[supernova]]. Deciding that he could find no circumstance where such a bomb would be justified, Hactar builds a small defect into it. After discovering the defect, the Armourfiends pulverize Hactar.

Over æons Hactar moves and recombines to become a dark cloud surrounding [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Krikkit|Krikkit]], isolating the inhabitants. Deciding that the decision not to destroy the universe was not his to make, he uses his influence to make them build their first space ship and discover the universe; he then manipulates them into the same rage which the Armourfiends possessed, urging that they destroy all other life. 

After an incredibly long and bloody galactic war, [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Judiciary Pag|Judiciary Pag]] banishes Krikkit to an envelope of "Slo-Time" to be released after the rest of the universe ends. At the end of [[Life, the Universe and Everything]], after his scheme fails, Hactar slips the cricket-ball-shaped supernova bomb to Arthur Dent, who then accidentally saves the Universe again by being an abysmal bowler.

Appears in:

*''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]''

He is played on radio first by [[Geoffrey McGivern]], in a flashback for which McGivern is not credited during [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#Fit the Seventeenth|Fit the Seventeenth]]. He is then voiced by [[Leslie Phillips]], appearing again in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#Fit the Eighteenth|Fit the Eighteenth]].

==Haggunenon Underfleet Commander==

The Underfleet Commander reports directly to the Haggunenon Admiral. The admiral had gone off for a quick meal at Milliways, where Ford and Zaphod attempted to steal his/her/its/their flagship. But as it had a pre-set return course, it resumed its place at the front of a hundred thousand horribly weaponed black battle cruisers. Because the [[Races and species in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Haggunenons|Haggunenons]] have very unstable DNA and change their shape/appearance at random and often inconvient times, the Underfleet Commander mistakenly assumes that Zaphod and Trillian are, in fact, the admiral. 

The Underfleet Commander only appears in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#Fit the Sixth|Fit the Sixth]], voiced by [[Aubrey Woods]]. The Haggunenons were written out of subsequent versions, as they were originally co-written with [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]], although they did appear in some stage adaptations.

Haggunenons are greatly inconvenienced by their genetic instability and so have vowed to wage terrible war against all "filthy rotten stinking same-lings"

This creature was later copied by [[Red Dwarf]].

==Happy Vertical People Transporters==
The lifts in the fictional ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' offices are called '''Happy Vertical People Transporters'''. Another "product" of Adams's fictional [[Sirius Cybernetics Corporation]], they are meant to be sentient enough to argue with and have "defocused temporal perception." The latter concept is meant to enable the lifts to see far enough into the future to arrive at a floor before a potential passenger realizes they wanted a lift, and thus remove any chatting, relaxing, and making friends people had to do whilst waiting for old-fashioned lifts.

The one lift with a voice appears in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#Fit the Seventh|Fit the Seventh]], voiced by David Tate. The lifts make a cameo appearance of sorts in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Quintessential Phase|The Quintessential Phase]].

==Hig Hurtenflurst==
'''Hig Hurtenflurst''' "only happens to be" the risingest young executive in the Dolmansaxlil Shoe Corporation.  During Fit the Eleventh, he is on [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Brontitall|Brontitall]].  What he is doing there is something of a mystery, as the [[Shoe Event Horizon]] was reached long ago and the survivors of the famine have long since evolved into bird people and set up home inside a thirteen-mile high statue of Arthur Dent.  His foot-warriors capture Arthur Dent and three Lintilla clones, who are threatened by Hurtenflurst to be "revoked. K-I-L-L-E-D, revoked".  He then proceeds to show them a film about the activities of the Dolmansaxlil Shoe Corporation, which is interrupted by Marvin, who has cut the power in order to rescue Arthur and the Lintillas.

He appeared in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#Fit the Eleventh|Fit the Eleventh]] of the original radio series, and was played by [[Marc Smith]].  He has not appeared in any versions after this.

==Hotblack Desiato==
[[Image:Hotblack Desiato estate agents - February 16 2005.jpg|thumbnail|right|250px|A branch of Hotblack Desiato estate agents, after which the character was named, at [[Camden Town]].]]
'''Hotblack Desiato''' is the ajuitar keyboard player of the [[rock music|rock]] group ''Disaster Area'', claimed to be the loudest band in the universe, and in fact the loudest sound of any kind, anywhere. So loud is this band that the audience usually listens from the safe distance of thirty seven miles away in a well-built concrete bunker. ''Disaster Area's'' lavish performances went so far as to crash a space ship into the sun to create a solar flare. [[Pink Floyd]]'s [[Pink Floyd live performances|lavish stage shows]] were the inspiration for ''Disaster Area''. (Incidentally, Douglas Adams was credited for coming up with the title of Pink Floyd's 1994 album ''[[The Division Bell]]''.) At the time when the main characters meet him, in ''[[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe]]'', Hotblack is spending a year [[death|dead]] "for tax reasons", though he is still psychically alive.

The character is named after an [http://www.hotblackdesiato.co.uk estate agency] based in [[Islington]], with branches throughout North [[London]]; Adams said he was struggling to find a name for the character and, spotting a Hotblack Desiato sign, liked the name so much he "nearly crashed the car" and eventually telephoned to ask permission to use the firm's name for a character. Apparently, the firm's staff later received phone calls telling them they had a nerve naming their company after Adams' character. 

The Disaster Area sub-plot was first heard in the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#LP album adaptations|LP album adaptations]] and later in ''[[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe]]''.  It replaces the [[Races and species in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Haggunenons|Haggunenon]] material from the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#Fit the Sixth|Fit the Sixth]] in the radio series.  The character appears in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)#Episode Five|episode five]], and his ship in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)#Episode Six|episode six]] of the TV series.  He does not have any lines, and is played by [[Barry Frank Warren]].

==Humma Kavula==
[[Image:Humma Kavula.jpg|thumb|200px|[[John Malkovich]] as Humma Kavula]]
'''Humma Kavula''' is a semi-insane missionary living amongst the [[Races from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Jatravartids|Jatravartid]] people of Viltvodle VI, and a former [[space pirate]]. (It was presumably during his time as a pirate that he lost his legs and had them replaced with telescoping mechanical spider appendages). He wears thick glasses, which make his eyes appear normal when worn; however, when he removes the glasses, he appears to have shrunken black pits where his eyes should be. He seems to be a religious leader on that planet, preaching about the ''Coming of the Great White Handkerchief'' (See [[Races from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Jatravartids|Jatravartids]]).

He also ran against [[Zaphod Beeblebrox]] in the campaign for President of the Galaxy with the campaign slogan "Don't Vote For Stupid," but lost, and has remained bitter about it ever since. In the film he is seeking the [[point-of-view gun]] to further his religion's acceptance, and he takes one of Zaphod's heads as hostage to ensure his help.

The character was created by Adams exclusively for the 2005 movie. Quoting Robbie Stamp: "All the substantive new ideas in the movie, Humma, the Point of View Gun and the "paddle slapping sequence" on Vogsphere are brand new Douglas ideas written especially for the movie by him." [http://slashdot.org/articles/05/04/26/1952248.shtml?tid=97&tid=133&tid=214] Appears in:

*''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' movie, played by [[John Malkovich]].

==Hurling Frootmig==
'''Hurling Frootmig''' is said to be the founder of the Hitchhiker's Guide, who established its
fundamental principles of honesty and idealism, and went bust. Later, after much soul-searching, he re-established the Guide with its principles of honesty and idealism and where you could stuff them, and went on to lead the Guide to its first major commercial success.

He is mentioned in ''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]''.  He did not make the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Tertiary Phase|Tertiary Phase]] of the radio series, but was mentioned in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#Fit the Twenty-Fourth|Fit the Twenty-Fourth]] of the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Quintessential Phase|Quintessential Phase]].

==Ix==
Ix is the childhood nickname of [[Ford Prefect (character)|Ford Prefect]], since his name in the native language of his father, who was from Betelgeuse 7, was unpronouncable in the language of his adopted home planet, Betelgeuse 5. See the [[Ford Prefect (character)|Ford Prefect]] article for further details.

==Judiciary Pag==
His High Judgmental Supremacy, '''Judiciary Pag''', L.I.V.R. (the Learned, Impartial, and Very Relaxed) was the Chairman of the Board of Judges at the [[Krikkit Wars|Krikkit War]] Crimes Trial. He privately called himself Zipo Bibrok 5x10<sup>8</sup> (which is half-a-billion). 

It was Judiciary Pag's idea that the people of Krikkit be permanently sealed in a Slo-Time envelope, and the seal could only be broken by bringing a special Key to the Lock. When the rest of the universe had ended, the seal would be broken and Krikkit could continue a solitary existence in the universe. This judgement seemed to please everybody except the people of Krikkit themselves, but the only alternative was to face annihilation.

Pag's real name shares some similarities with that of [[Zaphod Beeblebrox]], suggesting that he may be a distant ancestor (and therefore descendant) of Zaphod. 

Appears in:

*''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]''

He is played on radio by [[Rupert Degas]], and appears in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#Fit the Fifteenth|Fit the Fifteenth]].

==Karl Mueller==
Karl Mueller operates a nightclub, Club Alpha, in [[New York, New York|New York City]]. He is German with a Greek mother, and was handed the running of the club by his brother Stavro Mueller, who renamed Club Alpha with his own name. He appears in ''[[Mostly Harmless]]'', in the storyline regarding the final death of [[#Agrajag|Agrajag]].

==Krikkiters==

Ford, Arthur, Trillian and Slartibartfast meet a group of murderous Krikkiters on the surface of their planet.  Away from the influence of Hactar, they are troubled by their Elders wanting to destroy the Universe as they are keen to have sporting links with the rest of the Galaxy. They appear in [[Life, the Universe and Everything]] and the [[Tertiary Phase]] of the radio series.

==Mrs Enid Kapelsen==
An old woman from Boston who rediscovers purpose in life by seeing Arthur and Fenchurch flying (and performing other activities) outside the aeroplane within which she is flying to Heathrow. Witnessing this, she became enlightened, and realized that everything she had ever been taught was varyingly incorrect. She annoys the flight attendants by continually pressing her call button for reasons such as "the child in front was making milk come out of his nose." Later she ends up seated next to Arthur and Fenchurch on another aeroplane en route from Los Angeles to London (though in the radio series adaptation, she flies with Arthur and Fenchurch on a flight from London to Los Angeles).

Appears in:

*''[[So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish]]''

She was played by [[Margaret Robertson]] in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#Fit the Twenty-First|Fit the Twenty-First]] during the Quandary Phase.

==Know-Nothing Bozo the Non-Wonder Dog==
A dog belonging to advertiser Will Smithers which was so stupid that it was incapable of eating the right dog food on camera, even when engine oil was poured on the wrong food. It was so named because its hair stuck upright on its head in a way that resembled [[Ronald Reagan]] (The dog also had an adverse reaction whenever someone said the word "[[commies]]"). Bozo barked at Arthur whilst he considered entering the Horse and Groom pub on his return to earth in ''So Long and Thanks for all the Fish''.

==Kwaltz==
'''Kwaltz''' is one of the Vogons on Vogsphere, directing Jeltz's Vogon Constructor Fleet during the demolition of Earth and enforcing the galaxy's bureaucracy.

Appears in:

*''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' movie, voiced by [[Ian McNeice]].

==Lady Cynthia Fitzmelton==

'''Lady Cynthia Fitzmelton''' is described in the original radio script as "a sort of [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Penelope Keith]] character." She is responsible for christening the "very splendid and worthwhile yellow bulldozer" which knocks down Arthur Dent's house in "cruddy Cottington", and it gives her "great pleasure" to make a "very splendid and worthwhile" speech immediately beforehand.

She only appears in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#Fit the First|Fit the First]] of the radio series, where she was voiced by [[Jo Kendall]]. Her "very splendid and worthwhile" lines were entirely dropped from later versions.

==Lajestic Vantrashell of Lob==
Lajestic Vantrashell of Lob is a small man with a strange hat who guards God's Final Message to His Creation, and who sells Arthur and Fenchurch a ticket to it before passing them on a scooter and imploring them to "keep to the left".  Introduced by Prak in the epilogue to [[Life, the Universe and Everything]], he finally appears towards the end of [[So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish]] when we also realize that he has been a regular visitor to Wonko The Sane, who describes angels with golden beards and green wings, Dr Scholl sandals, who eat nachos and do a lot of [[cocaine|coke]].  He says that he runs a concession stand by the message and when Wonko says "I don't know what that means"  he says "no, you don't".

==Lallafa==
'''Lallafa''' was an ancient [[poet]] who lived in the [[forest]]s of the Long Lands of Effa. His home inspired him to write a poetic opus known as ''The Songs of the Long Land'' on pages made of dried habra [[leaf|leaves]]. His poems were discovered years after Lallafa's death, and news of them quickly spread. For centuries, the poems gave inspiration and illumination to many who would otherwise be much more unhappy, and for this they are usually considered around the Galaxy to be the greatest poetic works in existence. This is remarkable because Lallafa wrote his poems without the aid of [[education]] or [[correction fluid]].

The latter fact attracted the attention of some correction fluid manufacturers from the [[Manchester|Mancunian]] nebula. The manufacturers worked out that if they could get Lallafa to use their fluids in a variety of [[Chlorophyll|leafy colours]] in the course of his work, their companies would be as successful as the poems themselves. And so, they traveled back in time and beat Lallafa until he went along with their plan. The plan succeeded, Lallafa became extremely rich, and spent so much time on [[talk show|chat shows]] that he never got around to actually writing ''The Songs''. This was solved by each week, in the past, giving Lallafa a copy of his poems, from the present, and having him write his poems again for the first time. But on the condition that he make the odd mistake and use the correction fluid.

Some argued the poems were now worthless, and set out to stop this sort of thing with the Campaign for Real Time (a play on [[Campaign for Real Ale]]), or CamTim, to keep the flow of history untampered by time travel. [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Slartibartfast|Slartibartfast]] is a member of CamTim.

Lallafa appears in ''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]'' and [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#Fit the Fifteenth|Fit the Fifteenth]] of ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Tertiary Phase|The Tertiary Phase]]''.

==Lazlar Lyricon==
A customizer of starships to the rich and famous time travellers, from the second novel and the TV Series.

==Lig Lury, Jr==
The fourth editor of the Guide, who never actually resigned from his job. He simply left one morning for lunch and never returned to his office, making all later holders of the position "Acting Editors." His old office is still preserved by the Guide employees in the hope that he will return. His desk sports a sign that reads "Missing, presumed fed." The third novel, ''Life, the Universe and Everything'', relates his visit to the Holy Lunching Friars of Voondon.

==Lintilla==
'''Lintilla''' is a rather unfortunate woman who has (as of Fit the Eleventh) been [[Cloning|clone]]d 578,000,000,000 times due to an accident at a [[Brantisvogan]] [[escort agency]].  While creating six clones of a wonderfully talented and attractive woman named Lintilla (at the same time another machine was creating five hundred lonely business executives, in order to keep the laws of [[supply and demand]] operating profitably), the machine got stuck in a loop and malfunctioned in such a way that it got halfway through completing each new Lintilla before it had finished the previous one.  This meant that it was for a very long while impossible to turn the machine off without committing [[murder]], despite lawyers' best efforts to argue about what murder actually was, including trying to redefine it, repronounce it, and respelling it in the hope that no-one would notice.

Arthur Dent encounters three of her on the planet of [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Brontitall|Brontitall]], and takes a liking to (at least) one of them.  He kills one of three male anti-clones, all called Allitnil (Lintilla backwards), sent by the cloning company to get her to "agree to cease to be" (although the other two of her "consummate" this legal agreement with their respective anti-clones).  When Arthur leaves Zaphod, Ford, and [[Zarniwoop|Zarniwoop]] stranded with the Ruler of the Universe and his cat (at the conclusion of [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#Fit the Twelfth|the second radio series]]), he takes one of the Lintillas with him aboard the ''[[Heart of Gold (spaceship)|Heart of Gold]]''.

All Lintillas were played by the same actress: [[Rula Lenska]]. Lintilla (and her clones) appeared only in the final three episodes of the original radio series. Rula Lenska did return to the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases|fourth and fifth radio series]] - she was first an uncredited "Update Voice" for the Hitchhiker's Guide itself and then played the Voice of the Bird (the new version of the Guide introduced in [[Mostly Harmless]]).  Zaphod noted in the new series that the new book has the same voice as "those Lintilla chicks."  The footnotes of the published scripts make the connection, confirming that the bird is actually an amalgam of the Lintilla clones, the solution alluded to in the second series.  Lintilla and her clones do make a re-appearance of sorts on the ''Heart of Gold'' in an alternate ending to [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#Fit the Twenty-Sixth|the final episode]] (which can only be heard on CD).

The name Lintilla was reused for an adult-oriented [[Talker#Linked talkers .28.22Multiple Worlds.22.29|multiple worlds]] [[talker]], [[Lintilla (talker)|Lintilla]], that opened in 1994.

==Loonquawl==
In the original novel, Loonquawl is one of the two people who return to Deep Thought to find the answer to the Ultimate question.  The other is [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Phouchg|Phouchg]].

==Lord, The==
'''The Lord''' is a cat, owned by the [[#Ruler of the Universe, The|Ruler of the Universe]]. He might like fish and might like people singing songs to him, as the Ruler of the Universe isn't certain if people come to talk to him, or sing songs to his cat.

Appears in:

*''[[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe]]''

==Lord High Sanvalvwag of Hollop==
A man who was said to have globbered when he had forgotten his (non-existent) wife's birthday for the second year, and thus casts doubt on the usefulness of ''Ultra-Complete Maximegalon Dictionary''. (Life, the Universe and Everything)

==Lunkwill and Fook==
[[Image:Lunkwill and Fook.jpg|200px|right|"There is an answer?" said Fook with breathless excitement. "A simple answer?" added Lunkwill.]]'''Lunkwill''' and '''Fook''' are the two programmers chosen to make the great question to Deep Thought on the day of the Great On-Turning.

Appear in:

On TV, [[Antony Carrick]] plays Lunkwill and [[Timothy Davies]] plays Fook, and they appear in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)#Episode Four|Episode Four]].

On radio, the characters are just called ''First computer programmer'' and ''Second computer programmer'', and appear in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#Fit the Fourth|Fit the Fourth]], and are played by [[Ray Hassett]] and [[Jeremy Browne]] respectively.

In the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy movie]] they are merged with the characters of [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Franky and Benji mouse|Frankie  and Benjy mouse]].  [[Jack Stanley]] plays Lunkwill and [[Dominique Jackson]] plays Fook.

==Magician==
Appears wandering along a beach in [[Life, the Universe and Everything]], but no one needs him.

==Majikthise and Vroomfondel==
[[Image:Majikthise and Vroomfondel.jpg|right|200px|"You'll have a national Philosopher's strike on your hands!"]]'''Majikthise''' and '''Vroomfondel''' are [[philosophy|philosophers]], though they [[Cogito ergo sum|may not be]].  They make their appearance as representatives of the ''Amalgamated [[trade union|Union]] of Philosophers, Sages, Luminaries and other Professional Thinking Persons'' in order to protest a [[Demarkation dispute|demarcation dispute]] against the [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Deep Thought|Deep Thought]] computer being asked to determine the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything.  Through [[Winter of Discontent|contemporary]] satirical [[industrial relations]] references they maintain that the search for ultimate truth is the ''inalienable prerogative of your working thinkers''.  

Appear in:

*''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (book)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''

On radio, Majikthise was played by [[Jonathan Adams]] and Vroomfondel was played by [[Jim Broadbent]]. In the television series (but not on The Big Read), [[David Leland]] played Majikthise and [[Charles McKeown]] played Vroomfondel.

The characters were omitted from the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (movie)|movie]] version.

==Max Quordlepleen==
[[Image:Max Quordlepleen.jpg|200px|right|"I can see we're all in for a fabulous evening's apocalypse!"]]'''Max Quordlepleen''' is an entertainer who hosts at the Restaurant at the End of the Universe and the Big Bang Burger Bar (or "Big Bang Burger Chef" in the original radio version). His feelings about the Universe outside of his onstage persona are unclear, but he has witnessed its end over five hundred times.

Appears in:

*''[[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe]]''

On radio, [[Roy Hudd]] played him.  On television, it was [[Colin Jeavons]].

He re-appears in the final episode of the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Quintessential Phase|Quintessential Phase]] of the radio series, played by Roy Hudd again.

==Mo Minetti==
In [[Mostly Harmless]], it is Mo Minetti who had left, due to [[pregnant|pregnancy]], being the anchor the USAM TV breakfast show which Tricia McMillan is in New York to try out for.  Apparently, she declined, surprisingly for reasons of taste, to deliver her child on the air.

==Murray Bost Henson==
Murray Bost Henson is "a journalist from one of those papers with small pages and big print" as Arthur Dent puts it.  He is a friend of Arthur's whom Arthur phones one day to find out how he can get in touch with [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Wonko the Sane|Wonko the Sane]], and uses incredibly odd idioms in conversation, including such phrases as "my old silver tureen", "my old elephant tusk" and "my old prosthetic limb" (as terms of endearment) and "the Great Golden Spike in the sky" (referring to the death-place of old newspaper stories).

He is played in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#Fit the Twenty-First|Fit the Twenty-First]] of the Quandary Phase by [[Stephen Fry]].

==Old Man on the Poles==
Played by [[Sanjeev Bhaskar]] in the final radio series, the old man on the poles on [[Places in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Hawalius|Hawalius]],  tells Arthur some old information wrapped up as news, and that everyone should have a beach house.  The character appears in [[Mostly Harmless]].

==Old Thrashbarg==
Old Thrashbarg first appears in the book ''[[Mostly Harmless]]'', as a sort of priest on [[Places in the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Lamuella|Lamuella]], the planet on which Arthur becomes the Sandwich-Maker.  He worships [[#Almighty Bob|"Bob"]] and is often ignored by his villagers. Whenever he is questioned about Almighty Bob he merely describes him as "ineffable." No one on Lamuella knows what this means, because Thrashbarg owns the only dictionary, and it is "the ineffable will of Almighty Bob" that he keeps it to himself.

In the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Quintessential Phase|Quintessential Phase]] of the radio series he is voiced by [[Griff Rhys Jones]].

==Old Woman in the Cave==
In the village of oracles on Hawalius, the smelly '''Old Woman in the Cave''' provides Arthur Dent with bad olfactory stimulation, and a photocopied story of her life.  This occurs in ''Mostly Harmless''.

==Oolon Colluphid==
'''Oolon Colluphid''' is the author of several books on religious and other philosophical topics.  Colluphid's works include:

*''Where God Went Wrong''
*''Some More of God's Greatest Mistakes''
*''Who Is This God Person Anyway?''
*''Well That About Wraps It Up for God''
*''Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Guilt But Have Been Too Ashamed To Find Out
*''Everything You Never Wanted To Know About Sex But Have Been Forced To Find Out''

Colluphid is also shown as the author of the book ''The Origins of the Universe'' in the first part of the ''[[Destiny of the Daleks]]'' serial of ''[[Doctor Who]]''. [[Fourth Doctor|The Doctor]] scoffs that he "got it wrong on the first line". The reference was inserted by Douglas Adams, who was at the time working as the show's script editor.

An early version of Colluphid was the character ''Professor Eric Von Contrick'' appearing in a December 1976 episode of the BBC radio series [[The Burkiss Way]], which was based on author [[Erich Von Daniken]].  "Spaceships of the Gods", "Some more of my Spaceships of the Gods", "It shouldn't happen to Spaceships of the Gods",<ref>reference to "It Shouldn't Happen to a Vet", James Herriot Movie and Book[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079353/]</ref> were books by the fictional author who had a [[#Gag Halfrunt|Gag Halfrunt]]-style accent and who is visited in the Adams-written sketch by the aliens to demand a cut of Von Contrick's profits.<ref>"The Burkiss Way", [[Douglas Adams at the BBC]], BBC Audio</ref>

==Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings==
Writer of the worst poetry in the universe, as portrayed in all media except the original radio series.  This character replaces [[Paul Neil Milne Johnstone]], a real-life poet, who held the distinction on radio.  In the film version she has moved from Greenbridge, Essex, England to Sussex.

==Phouchg==
In the original novel, this is one of the characters who received Deep Thought's answer to Life, the Universe and Everything seven and a half million years after Deep Thought had been asked the question.  The other is [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Loonquawl|Loonquawl]].

==Poodoo==
'''Poodoo''' is a representative of the cloning company responsible for all the [[#Lintilla|Lintilla]] clones. He arrives on Brontitall with [[#Varntvar The Priest|Varntvar The Priest]] on a mission to 'revoke' the three Lintillas there by marrying them to their anti-clones, each of which is named [[#Allitnils, The|Allitnil]]. The marriage certificates are actually legally binding forms that make the signers agree to terminate their existence, and the unctuous Poodoo may therefore be a lawyer of some sort.

After two of the newly married couples disappear in unsmoke, Arthur shoots the third Allitnil dead and, after tying up Poodoo and Varntvar, forces them to listen to a recording of Marvin's autobiography, so as he says, "It's all over for them."

Poodoo only appears in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#Fit the Twelfth|Fit the Twelfth]] of the radio series, in which he is played by [[Ken Campbell (actor)|Ken Campbell]].

==Prak==
'''Prak''' was a witness in a trial on Argabuthon where the Dwellers in the Forest were suing the Princes of the Plains and the Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides. Prak was a messenger for Dwellers in the Forest sent to the other two parties to ask "the reason for this intolerable behaviour." The white robots of [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Krikkit|Krikkit]] broke into the court room to steal the Argabuthon Sceptre of Justice, as it was part of the [[Wikkit Gate]] Key. In so doing they may have jogged a surgeon's arm, while the surgeon was injecting Prak with [[Sodium thiopental|truth serum]], resulting in too high a dose. When the trial resumed, Prak was instructed to tell "the Truth, the Whole Truth, and Nothing but the Truth," which, due to the overdose, he did. People at the scene had to flee or risk insanity as Prak told every single bit of the entire truth of the entire universe and all of its history, much of which they found ghastly. Prak recalled that many of the weird bits involved [[frog]]s or [[Arthur Dent]]. As a result, when Arthur Dent came to visit him in search of the truth, he nearly died laughing. He never did write down anything he discovered while telling the truth, first because he could not find a pencil and then because he could not be bothered. He has therefore forgotten almost all of it, but did recall the address of God's Last Message to His Creation, which he gave to Arthur when the laughter subsided. He died afterwards, not having recovered from his laughing fit.

Appears in:

*''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]''

On radio he appears in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#Fit the Eighteenth|Fit the Eighteenth]] and is voiced by [[Chris Langham]], who had played Arthur Dent in the very first [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Stage Shows|stage adaptation]] of the scripts of the first radio series, in [[1979]].

==Pralite monks==
Pralite monks are an order that undergo extreme mental training before taking their final vows to be locked in small metal boxes for the rest of their lives; consequently, the galaxy is full of ex-Pralite monks who leave the order just before taking their final vows. Ford visited the ex-Pralite monks to Mind Surf and learnt the techniques he used to persuade Mr Prosser to let him take Arthur to the pub, in the first novel, and later to charm animals on prehistoric Earth long enough for him to kill them for food and clothing.

==President Hudson==
Fictional former president of the US who was publicly known to have had an affair with astrologer Gail Andrews in [[Mostly Harmless]]. One of his Presidential orders was the bombing of [[Damascus]] or "Damascectomy" (the taking out of Damascus), an issue Andrews denied that she counselled him on. At the time of "Mostly Harmless" Hudson had died for unknown reasons.

==Princess Hooli==
On the tri-d TV, Trillian Astra reports on the future wedding of '''Princess Hooli of Raui Alpha''' to Prince Gid of the Soofling Dynasty  whilst Arthur is visiting Hawalius in the final novel.  The seer who is showing Arthur the future news in order to demonstrate the sudden lack of need for future tellings quickly changes the channel.  Arthur says that he knows her and tells him to turn the channel back.  The seer replies "Look mate, if I had to stand here saying hello to everyone who came by who knew Princess Hooli..."

==Mr Prosser==
'''Mr L. Prosser''' is a somewhat nervous [[Great Britain road numbering scheme|roadbuilder]] who - perfectly reasonably - would like to do his job: building a [[Bypass route|bypass]] right through Arthur Dent's house. Very little is known about the man except for his predilection for little fur hats, his [[marital status]] (married), a desire to live in a small [[cottage]] with [[axes]] above the door (although Mrs. Prosser would prefer [[climbing roses]]), a direct and very distant [[kinship and descent|patrilineal descendant]] from [[#Genghis Temüjin Khan|Genghis Khan]], and occasional visions of [[Mongol]] hordes, which were a result of his nomadic ancestry.  He unfailingly addresses Arthur as "Mr Dent."

After some negotiation (with Ford Prefect in the novel, the television series, and the computer game but by Mr Dent in the radio series) he is temporarily convinced to take Mr Dent's place blocking the bulldozer threatening his (Mr Dent's) house whilst Mr Dent and Ford nip down to the local [[pub]]. While they are away, he quickly resumes the demolition of Mr Dent's house despite the earlier agreement, but is once again interrupted, for good this time, by the Vogon demolition of Earth.

Prosser holds the distinction of having the very first line of dialogue ever in the Hitchhiker's Guide canon, as he is the first character (not counting The Guide itself) to speak in Fit the First of the original series.

*''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (book)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''
*[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (computer game)|''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' (computer game)]]

On radio, he was played by [[Bill Wallis]] and appears in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#Fit the First|Fit the First]]. On television, he appears in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)#Episode One|Episode One]], played by [[Joe Melia]].  He is played by [[Steve Pemberton]] in the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (movie)|movie version]].  He appears in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#Fit the Twenty-Sixth|Fit the Twenty-Sixth]] in the fifth radio series, despite not appearing in the book ''[[Mostly Harmless]]'', voiced by [[Bruce Hyman]].

==Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz==
[[Image:Vogon poetry2.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Jeltz tortures [[Ford Prefect (character)|Ford Prefect]] and [[Arthur Dent]] with Vogon poetry in the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|film adaptation]].]]
The [[Vogon]] Captain in charge of overseeing the destruction of the Earth, '''Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz''' is sadistic, even by Vogon standards. When not shouting at or executing members of his own crew for insubordination, Jeltz enjoys torturing hitchhikers on board his ship by reading his [[Vogon poetry|poetry]] at them, then having them thrown out of an airlock into open space. 

Physically, Jeltz is described as being unpleasant to look at, even for other Vogons. Given that [[Ford Prefect (character)|Ford Prefect]] describes Vogons as having "as much sex appeal as a road accident", one can only imagine how much worse Jeltz must appear. This may explain his disposition.

It is revealed in ''[[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe]]'' that Jeltz had been hired by [[#Gag Halfrunt|Gag Halfrunt]] to destroy the Earth. Halfrunt had been acting on behalf of a consortium of psychiatrists and the Imperial Galactic Government in order to prevent the discovery of the Ultimate Question. When Halfrunt learns that [[Arthur Dent]] escaped the planet's destruction, Jeltz is dispatched to track him down and destroy him. Jeltz is unable to complete this task, due to the intervention of [[#Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth|Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth]], Zaphod's great-grandfather.

In ''[[Mostly Harmless]]'', Jeltz is once again responsible for the destruction of the Earth, this time presumably killing Arthur, Ford, [[Trillian (character)|Trillian]], and Arthur's daughter, [[#Random Dent|Random]].

"Prostetnic Vogon" may be a title, rather than part of his name, since during the second episode of the third radio series (Fit the Fourteenth), two other Prostetnic Vogons are heard from. Also, in ''[[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe]]'', Gag Halfrunt refers to Jeltz as "Captain of Vogons Prostetnic" (although this may have been a play on Halfrunt's accent).

In the first radio series, he was played by [[Bill Wallis]].  On television, it was [[Martin Benson]]. In the third, fourth and fifth radio series, he was played by [[Toby Longworth]], although Longworth did not receive a credit for the role during the third series. In the film, he is voiced by [[Richard Griffiths]].

==Questular Rontok==
[[Image:Questular Rontok.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Questular Rontok.]]
'''Questular Rontok''' is the Vice President of the Galaxy.  She is desperately in love with [[Zaphod Beeblebrox]], the fugitive President of the Galaxy, and he knows it, as she unsuccessfully tries to hide it.  Throughout the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|feature film]], Questular alternately tries to arrest Zaphod for stealing the ''[[Heart of Gold (spaceship)|Heart of Gold]]'' (even enlisting the help of the [[Vogons]]), protects his life (when endangered by Vogon blaster fire), and at one point beseeches him to just give the stolen spaceship up.  Questular appears to be the "doer", performing all the real functions of the Presidency, whilst Zaphod enjoys his status as the figurehead President.  After [[Trillian (character)|Trillian]] repeatedly zaps Zaphod with the [[Point-of-view gun]] and he learns that she is truly in love with [[Arthur Dent]] and not him, he and Questular end up together at the end of the film.  Questular is also severely jealous of Trillian for obvious reasons ("She's lying. She's thin and she's pretty, and she's ''lying''!"), until Trillian and Zaphod part as lovers. In the early drafts of the film the character was male, and therefore somewhat different. In a deleted scene on the DVD, Questular expresses her love for Zaphod shortly after all the Vogons become depressed.

Appears in:

*''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' movie, played by [[Anna Chancellor]].

==Receptionists==
===New York Hotel receptionist===
In ''[[Mostly Harmless]]'' Tricia gets garbled messages via the receptionist from Gail Andrews. Tricia interprets the message "Not happy," as meaning Gail Andrews wasn't happy with their interview.

===Megadodo receptionist===
Appearing in the [[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe|second novel]] and [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#Fit the Seventh|Fit the Seventh]] the large, pink-winged, insectoid receptionist in the Megadodo offices points Zaphod using a petulant tentacle towards Zarniwoop's office, the one with a whole electronic universe in it, and is also bugged by Marvin who just wants someone to talk to. In the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Quintessential Phase|Quintessential Phase]], he directs Zaphod towards Zarniwoop's new office, having put on the old hippy act.

==Random Dent==
Originally prophesied by her father, Arthur Dent, after he hears a Vogon for the first time, a disillusioned, teenaged '''Random Frequent Flyer Dent''' (the in-vitro progeny with Tricia McMillan) is found in ''[[Mostly Harmless]]''. The line "I wish I had a daughter, so I could forbid her to marry [a Vogon]" is only followed up in the 2005 radio series adaptation of ''Mostly Harmless''. The new [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]]-reminiscent black bird version of the Guide manipulates her (as it has the Grebulons and Ford Prefect), so she is indirectly responsible for the destruction of all possible Earths.

Early in [[Mostly Harmless]], [[Arthur Dent|Arthur]], travels from planet to planet by donating to "DNA banks", finding that for semen deposits, he can travel first class.  

Appears in:

*''[[Mostly Harmless]]''

In the final radio series, [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Quintessential Phase|The Quintessential Phase]] adapted from ''[[Mostly Harmless]]'', she is played by [[Samantha Béart]] (formerly known as [[Sam Burke]]).

==Reg Nullify==
'''Reg Nullify''' leads the "Cataclysmic Combo" band at Milliways. His band&mdash;from the second novel&mdash;performed on the LP album/cassette re-recording of Fit the Fifth and Fit the Sixth of the original radio series, released as ''The Restaurant at the End of the Universe''. The role was played by [[Graham de Wilde]]. Their song was also released as a single.

{{Listen|filename=Reg Nullify.ogg

==Rob McKenna==
Described in the fourth book as a "Quasi Supernormal Incremental Precipitation Inducer," '''Rob McKenna''' is an ordinary lorry driver who can never get away from rain and he has a book of <s>231</s> 233 types to prove it. Arthur suggests that he could show the diary to someone, which Rob does, making the media deem him a 'Rain God,' for the clouds want to be near him, to love him, to water him. This windfall gives him a lucrative career of not travelling to places for money.

Appears in:

*''[[So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish]]''

In the radio series, he appears in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#Fit the Nineteenth|Fits the Nineteenth]], [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#Fit the Twentieth|Fits the Twentieth]] and [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#Fit the Twenty-First|Fits the Twenty-First]] and is played by [[Bill Paterson]], who also played one of the [[#Arcturan Megafreighter crew|Arcturan Megafreighter crew]] in Fit the Seventh.

==Roosta==
'''Roosta''' is a hitchhiker and researcher for the Guide, whom Ford Prefect knows, at least in passing.  He carries a special towel with nutrients infused into one corner, and barbecue sauce stains in an opposite corner, which can be obtained by sucking the towel (certain bits of the towel taste vile beyond all imagining, and for this reason, one part of the towel also contains anti-depressants to go along with the barbecue sauce, ostensibly for use when vile nutrient-soaked end depresses him). He saves Zaphod Beeblebrox from a horrible death in the offices of the Hitchhiker's Guide (by taking him into the artificial universe in Zarniwoop's office), and is then kidnapped along with Zaphod and the left-hand tower of the Guide building by a squadron of Frogstar Fighters. In the radio series, he serves no other purpose than to provide conversation (and deliver the line "here Zaphod, suck this!") while the pair are travelling to the Frogstar; however, in the books, he tells Zaphod to climb out of the window onto the surface of Frogstar World B, which ensures Zaphod remains in Zarniwoop's universe and can survive the [[Total Perspective Vortex]].

Appears in:

On radio, he was voiced by [[Alan Ford (actor)|Alan Ford]].

==The Ruler of the Universe==
'''The Ruler of the Universe''' is a man living in a small shack on a world that can only be reached with a key to an improbability field or use of an [[Infinite Improbability Drive]]. He does not want to rule the universe and tries not to whenever possible, and therefore is by far the ideal candidate for the job. He has an odd, [[solipsistic]] view of reality: he lives alone with his cat, which he has named [[#Lord.2C The|'The Lord']] even though he is not certain of its existence. He has a very dim view of the past, and he only believes in what he sees with his eyes and ears (and doesn't seem too certain of that, either): anything else is [[hearsay]], so when executive-types visit to ask him what he thinks about certain matters, such as wars and the like, he tells them how he feels without considering consequences.  As part of his refusal to accept that anything is true, or simply as another oddity, he even talked to his [[table]] for a week to see how it would react. He does sometimes admit that some things may be more likely than others – e.g. that he might like a glass of whiskey, which the visitors leave for him... 

In the radio adaptation of ''[[Mostly Harmless]]'', Ford also meets Zaphod in the accounting department of the new Guide offices. Zaphod describes being bored by a man in a shack and his cat for over a year.

*''[[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe]]''

Referenced in:

*''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Quintessential Phase|The Quintessential Phase of the Radio Series]]''

He was voiced on radio by [[Stephen Moore]] (in the original ''[[Radio Times]]'' listing he was announced as being played by [[Ron Hate]] - an anagram of "A.N.Other" - because the show was so far behind schedule that the role had not been cast when the magazine went to print).

==Russell==
'''Russell''' is Fenchurch's burly, blonde-moustached, blow-dried brother. He picks up Arthur Dent in his car after he arrived on Earth at the beginning of the fourth book.  Arthur and Russell take an instant dislike to each other but this is also the first time he meets Fenchurch, his lover and co-flyer to be - albeit she is asleep or in a comatose/fugue state and only utters one word - "This" - then lapses back into wherever she is.  Fenchurch also doesn't like Russell - he calls her "Fenny" which she dislikes intensely. He also tries to simplify her problems so he can explain and understand them better (for example, he tells Arthur that Fenchurch believes herself to be a hedgehog).

He first appeared in the book ''[[So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish]]'', and when this was adapted to radio appears in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary through Quintessential Phases#Fit the Nineteenth|Fit the Nineteenth]], where he is played by [[Rupert Degas]].

==Safety and Civil Reassurance Administration Officials==
In the story [[Young Zaphod Plays it Safe]], a young Zaphod visits the wreck of the Starship Billion Year Bunker that has crashed on the planet with the best lobsters in the Western Galaxy.  He is accompanied by two Officials from the Safety and Civil Reassurance Administration and an empty spacesuit, as they search for [[aorist rods]] and a Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Designer Person (babbling gently about a shining city on a hill) who it turns out has escaped to earth.  The Officials declare the planet must be made "perfectly safe".

==Sheila Steafel==
Whilst living in a cave on prehistoric Earth, Arthur Dent visits (via a dream) comedian [[Sheila Steafel]] on the radio show Steafel Plus on [[4 August]] [[1982]].  Arthur, in his dressing gown, explains of missing Mars Bars, certain types of tea and Radio 4's News Quiz, Chat Shows, the Archers and Just a Minute.  "There is nothing quite like [[Kenneth Williams]] in the entire galaxy, I've looked!"  Space, he says, is staggering, bewilderingly dull: there is so much of it and so little in it, "it sometimes reminds me of [[The Observer]]".   

Adams wrote this segment specifically for Steafel's show, and Simon Jones appeared in character as Arthur Dent. Thus Steafel herself became a ''Hitchhiker's'' character.<ref>"The Lost HitchHiker's Sketch", [[Douglas Adams at the BBC]], BBC Audio </ref>

==Shooty and Bang Bang==
[[Image:Shooty and bang bang.jpg|200px|right|"I go around shooting people gratuitously and then I agonize about it afterwards for hours to my girlfriend!"]]'''Shooty''' and '''Bang Bang''' are Blagulon galactic [[policeman|policemen]].  They pursue Zaphod Beeblebrox to the planet of Magrathea, whereupon they proceed to shoot at him.  In the radio and television series, this results in a large computer exploding and throwing Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect and Zaphod forwards in time to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe.  In the books, Arthur, Ford and Zaphod are saved from certain death when Marvin talks to the cops' spaceship, which subsequently becomes so depressed it commits suicide, disabling the cops' life support units and rendering them unable to breathe as they were described as being "methane breathers."

Bang Bang and Shooty appear in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (book)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]. Bang Bang was played on radio by [[Ray Hassett]] and on television by [[Marc Smith]]. Shooty was played on radio by [[Jim Broadbent]] and on television by [[Matt Zimmerman]].

In the Illustrated Guide to the Galaxy, the pair are played by Douglas Adams and Ed Victor (his literary agent).

The pair were written as parodies of [[United States|American]] [[List of police shows|cop show]] characters, particularly ''[[Starsky and Hutch]]''. The characters are never named in dialogue or in the novels, but are named in the original radio series scripts.

==Six Men==
In their six starships, the Six Men are the only people who have, as far as he is aware, the key to the unprobability field that locks away The Ruler of the Universe.  This occurs in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#Fit the Twelfth|Fit the Twelfth]] and the [[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe|second novel]].

==Stavro Mueller==
Ran Club Alpha in New York, visited by Tricia McMillan in [[Mostly Harmless]].  We are told that he was was a Greek with a German father and has handed Club Alpha over to his brother Karl Mueller so Stavro can open a new club in London.  In the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Quintessential Phase|Quintessential Phase]] Stavro is an only child.

==Strinder the Tool Maker==
As Arthur is regarded as The Sandwichmaker from Bob on the remote iron-age planet of Lamuella, Strinder makes knives to cut the Perfectly Normal Beast for his sarnies.  From [[Mostly Harmless]] and [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Quintessential Phase|The Quintessential Phase]]

== Slartibartfast ==
{{main|Slartibartfast}}

==Sulijoo==
Another friend of Disaster Area's Hotblack Desiato who Ford says agreed with him that Disaster Area was going to make Hotblack a star.  Appears in the second novel.

==The thing at the Resettlement Advice Centre on Pintleton Alpha==
This character advises Arthur to settle on Bartledan in [[Mostly Harmless]], but is the telepathic Resettlement officer on NowWhat in the final radio series.

==Thor==

[[Thor]] is a figure in [[Norse mythology]].  He first appears at [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Milliways|Milliways]], and is mentioned in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#Fit the Fifth|Fit the Fifth]] of the radio series, [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)#Episode Five|Episode Five]] of the television series, and the book [[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe]]. He has no lines in either of these.

He next appears in the book ''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]'', at a party, where he is chatting up [[Trillian (character)|Trillian]].  Arthur tricks him into stepping out of the (flying) building by challenging him to a fight.  In the radio adaptation of this he appears in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#Fit the Sixteenth|Fit the Sixteenth]], where he is played by [[Dominic Hawksley]].  Hawksley reprises the role in the radio adaptation of ''[[Mostly Harmless]]'', the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#Quintessential Phase|Quintessial Phase]], despite not appearing in that book.  Two other characters from the Restaurant - [[#Max Quordlepleen|Max Quordlepleen]] and [[#Zarquon|Zarquon]] also appear.

Thor also appears in the [[Dirk Gently]] novel ''[[The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul]]''.

==Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides==  	 
These tribesmen fought with (in the epilogue of Life the Universe and Everything) the Princes of the Plains in the land of the Dwellers in the Forest, to the detriment of the latter, for a really good reason, but [[#Prak|Prak]] cannot remember why.

==Trin Tragula==
'''Trin Tragula''' was a speculative philosopher who invented the [[Total Perspective Vortex]] basically in order to annoy his wife. His wife thought he was an idiot who needed to "have some sense of perspective", exhorting her view frequently. When he attached his wife to the Total Perspective Vortex, the shock of seeing herself in relation to the rest of the universe instantly annihilated her brain. Although he was horrified by this, Trin Tragula found some satisfaction in discovering that the one thing that a person cannot afford to have in a universe this size is a sense of perspective.

==Varntvar The Priest==
He has only four lines in the programme, accompanying [[#Poodoo|Poodoo]] and [[#Allitnils, The|the Allitnils]] in the conspiracy to destroy [[#Lintilla|Lintilla's]] clones.

Varntvar is eventually forced to listen to a tape of Marvin's autobiography.

He appears only in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#Fit the Twelfth|Fit the Twelfth]] of the radio series, in which he is played by [[Geoffrey McGivern]].

==Veet Voojagig==
'''Veet Voojagig''' was described as "a quiet, young student at the University of Maximegalon", who initially studied ancient [[philology]], transformational [[ethics]] and the [[Wave Harmonic Theory of Historical Perception]]. Then, after drinking some [[Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster]]s with [[Zaphod Beeblebrox]], he became obsessed with the problem of what happens to all his used [[ballpoint pen]]s. Voojagig claimed to have discovered the solution, that they disappear to a world of their own, and claimed further to have worked on that world. The character was described as ending up in "tax exile" &ndash; and may have had a hand in "Zaphod Beeblebrox's highly profitable second-hand [pen] business." Also of note that when others visited the planet where Veet Voojagig claimed to have lived, all they found was a small asteroid inhabited by "a strange old man who repeatedly claimed that nothing was true, though he was later found to be lying."

==Vroomfondel and Majikthise==

See [[#Majikthise and Vroomfondel|Majikthise and Vroomfondel]]

==War Command Krikkiters==
Zaphod overheard the two '''War Command Krikkiters''' in the Robot War Zones, discussing the lassitude of the Krikkit War Robots, saying ''The war, sir, it seems to be getting them down.  They just seem to get a little tired and a little grim ... and then they sulk''.  [[Life, the Universe and Everything]].

==Will Smithers==
Owner of a grey Porsche 928S (which [[#Rob McKenna|Rob McKenna]] a has been blocking for 20 miles) with a sticker that reads "My other car is also a Porsche", Will soaks Arthur Dent (and fails to give him a lift) when he is hitchhiking back on Earth at the beginning of [[So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish]].  Will works in advertising and drinks in Arthur's local pub, the Horse and Groom and is owner of [[#Know-Nothing Bozo the Non-Wonder Dog|Know-Nothing Bozo the Non-Wonder Dog]].

==Whale==
A [[sperm whale]] called suddenly and instantly into existence by the Heart of Gold's improbability drive, above the planet Magrathea alongside Agrajag (as a bowl of flowers) this creature has a very self-aware extensential life of discovery which sadly lasts only a minute before it impacts the ground, leaving a large crater and quite a lot of atomized whale remains. It appears in the first novel, the TV Series, the Motion Picture, and Fit the Third. Voiced by [[Stephen Moore]] in the radio and TV series, and by [[Bill Bailey]] in the movie.

==Wise Old Bird, The==
'''The Wise Old Bird''' is the leader of the [[bird-people|Bird People]] of [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Brontitall|Brontitall]].  He does not like saying the word "[[shoe]]", as he and the bird people consider it unspeakable. The Bird People live in the right ear of a thirteen-mile-high statue of Arthur Dent, constructed by their ancestors.

The Wise Old Bird appeared in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#Fit the Tenth|Fit the Tenth]] of the original radio series.  He was voiced by [[John Le Mesurier]].

==Wonko the Sane==
'''John Watson''' aka '''Wonko the Sane''' lives in coastal California with his wife, Arcane Jill Watson, in a house called ''The Outside of the Asylum'' (which features interior features on its outside and exterior on its inside). When Wonko saw [http://homepage.ntlworld.com/doklands/images/toothpicks2.png instructions on how to use a toothpick] on a packet of [[toothpick]]s he became convinced that the world had gone crazy and so built the house as an asylum for it, hence the reversal of the interior and exterior. [[Arthur Dent|Arthur]] and [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Fenchurch|Fenchurch]] pay Wonko a visit and learn that like the both of them, he had also received a fishbowl from the dolphins (having been a [[marine biologist]] and close to them). He also claims to have seen angels with golden beards, green wings and [[Dr. Scholl's|Dr Scholl]] sandals, who drive little scooters, do a little [[Cocaine|coke]] and are very cool about a lot of things. Arthur and Fenchurch discover the truth behind this after they have seen [[God]]'s Last Message to His Creation.

Appears in:

*''[[So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish]]''

In the radio series, he is played by [[Christian Slater]].

==Wowbagger, the Infinitely Prolonged==
'''Wowbagger''' is an [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|alien]] who became [[immortality|immortal]] by accident, so therefore does not know how to handle being immortal. This is in contrast to the rest of the immortal beings in the universe, who are, in his opinion, "a bunch of serene bastards." He eventually comes up with a plan to keep himself busy: he will insult every living being in the universe - in alphabetical order. He appears in the third book, ''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]'', while insulting [[Arthur Dent]] with the phrase: "Dent, you're a jerk... A complete asshole" (in the US changed to "...complete kneebiter"). 

Wowbagger is also present in ''The Private Life of Genghis Khan[http://www.douglasadams.com/dna/980707-07-s.html]'', where he insults [[#Genghis Temüjin Khan|Genghis Khan]], provoking him to burn down large segments of [[Asia]].

In the new radio series, he is voiced by [[Toby Longworth]]. In the Quintessential Phase, he finally reaches the end of his quest by insulting the Great Prophet [[#Zarquon|Zarquon]], who revokes Wowbagger's immortality.

Appears in:

*''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]''
*''The Private Life of Genghis Khan'', published in ''[[The Salmon of Doubt]]''

==Yooden Vranx==

'''Yooden Vranx''' is the late former President of the Galaxy, the one before [[Zaphod Beeblebrox]]. Just before his death, Yooden came to see Zaphod and presented his idea to steal the ''[[Heart of Gold (spaceship)|Heart of Gold]]''. He also convinced Zaphod to lock out one part of his brains so that no one could figure out why Zaphod ran for the presidency. Before becoming the President of the Galaxy, Yooden Vranx was a captain of an Arcturan megafreighter. 

Zaphod and [[Ford Prefect (character)|Ford Prefect]] first met Yooden when they were children on [[Betelgeuse]]. Zaphod had souped up a trijet scooter and he and Ford raided Yooden's megafreighter on a bet. After storming the bridge with toy pistols and demanding [[conker]]s, Yooden gave them both conkers, food, booze, and various other items before teleporting the pair back to the maximum security wing of the Betelgeuse state prison.

==Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth==

The great-grandfather of [[Zaphod Beeblebrox]], '''Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth''' is one of two active characters in books who are ''dead'' (see also: [[#Hotblack Desiato|Hotblack Desiato]]). When [[Arthur Dent]] inadvertently freezes the systems on board [[Heart of Gold (spaceship)|Heart of Gold]] at the same moment [[#Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz|Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz]] attacks, the younger Zaphod holds a seance to contact Zaphod the Fourth.

Zaphod the Fourth berates his great-grandchild for being generally self-absorbed and learns of the ship's imminent destruction. He stops time so he can continue deriding Zaphod, who tries (rather weakly) to defend his life. Zaphod the Fourth saves the ship and crew to keep his great-grandchild and his "modern friends" from joining him in the afterlife and thereby ruining the experience. 

When he learns that the ship had seized up to solve the dilemma of either making tea (in [[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe]]) or figuring out why Arthur would want dried leaves in water (on radio, Fit the Ninth), he solves these problems before leaving by either leaving a pot of tea in the Nutri-Matic Drink Synthesizer or by explaining to [[#Eddie|Eddie]] that "he's an ignorant monkey who doesn't know better", respectively.  In the book Z.B. the Fourth approves of the tying up of all computer resources to make tea - unlike everyone else present on the ''Heart Of Gold'' at the time, including Arthur who originally made the request of  Eddie.

As a final note, Zaphod explains that his great-grandfather is "the Fourth" due to an accident with a contraceptive and a time machine. Zaphod the Fourth, therefore, bitterly refers to his great-grandson as "Zaphod Beeblebrox the Nothingth".

Appears in:

*''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#Fit the Ninth|Fit the Ninth]]'' of the original radio series
*''[[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe]]''

He was voiced on radio by Richard Goulden.

==Zarniwoop / Vann Harl==
'''Zarniwoop''' works in the offices of the Guide, on [[Places in The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy Ursa Minor Beta|Ursa Minor Beta]]. When Zaphod travels to Ursa Minor Beta to meet him, he is informed that Zarniwoop is unavailable and too cool to see him right now. He ''is'' in his office, but he's on an intergalactic [[cruise]]. Zaphod subsequently discovers that Zarniwoop's intergalactic cruise has been spending 900 years on [[Places in The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy Frogstar World B|Frogstar B]], waiting for its complement of small [[lemon]]-soaked paper napkins, and every single passenger has aged considerably despite enforced hibernation. Only one person, who was not a passenger, but who hid himself on the spaceship, has not aged &ndash; Zarniwoop. Zaphod subsequently learns that, before he sealed part of his own [[brain]], he was collaborating with Zarniwoop to find out who rules the universe – this being Zarniwoop's obsession. In the books, Zarniwoop is marooned on [[Ruler of the Universe, The|The Ruler of the Universe]]'s planet by Zaphod et al. and is stuck outside the only shelter for weeks in driving rain, because The Ruler is unsure as to whether Zarniwoop's desperate thumping on  the door is real or not.  At the end of the second radio series, he is similarly marooned, but this time by Arthur, with Ford Prefect and Zaphod Beeblebrox for company.

In the Quintessential Phase radio series, Zarniwoop is revealed to be the same person as the ''Mostly Harmless'' character Vann Harl (Zarniwoop is his first name), and a Vogon in disguise. He has escaped being left on the desolate planet and is masterminding the Guide's new all-powerful format.

Appears in:

*''[[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe]]''
*''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]''

On the radio, Zarniwoop Vann Harl is voiced by [[Jonathan Pryce]].  His casting was accidental – he had been hired to play a different role (the [[Ruler of the Universe, The|Ruler of the Universe]], whose lines had apparently not been written in time). He was happy to return for the final series, however, when a lot more was revealed about the character, much of it appropriately sinister, Pryce now having become well known for playing villains.

==Zarquon==
[[Image:Zarquon.jpg|200px|right|"Er, look, I'm sorry I'm a bit late. I've had the most ghastly time, all sorts of things cropping up at the last moment."]]'''Zarquon''' is a legendary [[prophet]].  He is worshipped by a small group visiting The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, and is old, bearded, robed, wreathed in light, has stary eyes and a crown of gold.  His name is frequently invoked as a curse, such as "Holy Zarquon's singing fish" and "for zark's sake."  

It is only on ''our'' visit to Milliways, does Zarquon appear - his overdue second coming. The host Max had done the show ''over five hundred times'' and ''nothing like this had ever happened before''. 

He appears in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#Fit the Fifth|Fit the Fifth]], voiced by [[Anthony Sharp]], in the book''[[The Restaurant at the End of the Universe]]'' and in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (TV series)#Episode Five|Episode Five]] is played by [[Colin Bennett (UK TV)|Colin Bennett]].

He has a final brief cameo in [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Tertiary to Quintessential Phases#The Quintessential Phase|The Quintessential Phase]] played by [[William Franklyn]].

==Zem==
'''Zem''' is an affable, yet quite stupid, swampdwelling [[mattress]] (probably of very high quality) who flollops around [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Squornshellous Zeta|Squornshellous Zeta]] and tries his best to cheer up Marvin the Paranoid Android, who became stranded on the planet after having one arm welded to his side and one leg replaced by a steel pillar which turns out to be of immense importance, with utterly predictable results.  After attempting to make conversation about the weather, Marvin's life story, and the economy of Squornshellous itself, Zem offers that Marvin should be more mattresslike.  Zem is also the sole witness to Marvin's [[Abduction Phenomenon|abduction]] by the Krikkit war robots.

Also note that "Zem" is the name of ''all'' Squornshellous Zeta mattresses, because as Zem puts it "Some of us get killed... but we never know which, and thus globbering" [A mattress noise expressing sympathy] "are kept to a minimum."

Appears in:

*''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]''

On radio, he is voiced by [[Andy Taylor (actor)|Andy Taylor]].

'''''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy''''',<ref>The spelling of ''Hitchhiker's Guide'' has varied in different editions.  For consistency this article always spells it this way. See [[Spelling of Hitchhiker's Guide]].</ref> was a BBC television adaptation of [[Douglas Adams]]'s ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' broadcast in January and February [[1981]] on [[BBC Two]]. The adaptation followed the original [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (radio series)|radio series]] in [[1978]] and [[1980]], the first novel and double LP, in [[1979]], and the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Stage shows|stage shows]], in 1979 and 1980, making it  the fifth version of the guide.

The series starred [[Simon Jones (actor)|Simon Jones]] as [[Arthur Dent]], [[David Dixon]] as [[Ford Prefect]], [[Mark Wing-Davey]] as [[Zaphod Beeblebrox]] and [[Sandra Dickinson]] as [[Trillian (character)|Trillian]]. The voice of the guide was by [[Peter Jones]]. Simon Jones, Peter Jones and Mark Wing-Davey all reprised their roles from the radio series. In addition, the series saw a number of notable cameo roles, including Adams himself on several occasions.

Although initially thought by BBC executives to be unfilmable, the series was successfully produced and directed by [[Alan J W Bell]] and went on to win an [[Royal Television Society]] award as Most Original Programme of 1981, as well as several BAFTA awards for its graphics and editing. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081874/awards|title="The Hitch Hikers Guide to the Galaxy" (1981) (mini) - Awards|accessdate=2007-05-04}}</ref>

== Development and production ==

After the success of the first seven episodes of the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (radio series)|radio series]], all broadcast in 1978, and while the second radio series was being recorded, [[Douglas Adams]] was commissioned to deliver a pilot script for a television adaptation on 29 May 1979, to be delivered by 1 August.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Andrew Pixley|date=22 December 2004|title=One Step Beyond|journal=Doctor Who Magazine Special Edition: The Complete Fourth Doctor Volume Two|pages=Page 30}}</ref> A fully-animated version was briefly discussed in the autumn of 1978, but it was eventually decided to make most of the series feature "live action" and only animate ''The Guide'''s entries.<ref>{{cite book | author=Simpson, M. J. | title=Hitchhiker: A Biography of Douglas Adams | edition =First U.S. Edition | publisher=Justin Charles & Co. | year=2003 | id=ISBN 1-932112-17-0 |pages=Page 155}}</ref> [[John Lloyd (writer)|John Lloyd]], who had worked with Adams on the first radio series, is credited with starting the process of adapting the series for television, after the receipt of the pilot script, with a memo to the Head of Light Entertainment ([[John Howard Davies]]) in September 1979.<ref>{{cite book | author=Simpson, M.

Page 31.</ref>The script for the pilot was delivered in December 1979, and terms for the five remaining scripts were agreed upon in January 1980. While there was some resistance to a project considered "unfilmable," [[Alan J W Bell]] was given the duties to produce and direct the TV adaptation. John Lloyd was signed as Associate Producer.
[[Image:Arthur Dent Livid.jpg|thumb|right|[[Simon Jones (actor)|Simon Jones]] as [[Arthur Dent]], watching his home being demolished in the first television episode.]]
In early 1980, production on the pilot episode began on several fronts. [[Rod Lord]], of [[Pearce Animation Studios]], directed a 50 second pilot, hand-animated, giving a 'computer graphic' feel to the [[Babel Fish]] speech of the first episode. [[Douglas Adams]] and Alan J.W. Bell were both pleased with the animation, and Lord was given the "go ahead" to do all of the animation for episode one (and subsequently the complete TV series).<ref>Simpson, ''Hitchhiker''. Page 157.</ref> Narration for the first episode was recorded by [[Peter Jones]] in March 1980. The filming of two green-skinned aliens reacting to [[Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster]]s was done on [[8 May]] [[1980]]. Further filming of crowd reactions to the [[Vogon]]s, location filming of "Arthur's House" and a scene in a pub were done between 11 and [[16 May]] [[1980]]. Scenes aboard the Vogon ship were recorded on [[7 June]] [[1980]], in the BBC's TC1 studio. The final edit of the pilot episode was completed on [[2 July]] [[1980]], and it was premiered for a test audience three days later ([[5 July]] [[1980]]). Further test screenings were held in August 1980. Based on successful test screenings, the cast were reassembled to complete the six episodes of the series in September 1980. Production continued through the fall, with filming and recording occurring "out of order." Recording and production on the final episode continued into January 1981.

The gap in production made for some continuity problems between the pilot episode and the remainder, Notably, Simon Jones' hair was cut short for another role, and he wears a noticeable hairpiece in later episodes. Conversely, Dixon's hair appears longer.

One major change first appeared in the stage show and LP adaptations, and made its way into the novels and TV adaptation. Nearly all of the sequences from Fit the Fifth and Fit the Sixth in the first radio series that were originally co-written with John Lloyd were completely cut. Thus the [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Hotblack Desiato|Hotblack Desiato]] character and [[Disaster Area]] make appearances in TV episode five, and [[Ford Prefect (character)|Ford]], [[Arthur Dent|Arthur]], [[Zaphod Beeblebrox|Zaphod]] and [[Trillian (character)|Trillian]] are all randomly teleported off of Disaster Area's stunt ship in TV episode six. Lloyd does receive a co-writer's credit on episode five, for the material on the statistics about the universe.

The complexities of adapting the material for television meant that some episodes became as long as 35 minutes, and some would say that the best jokes from the radio series had to be cut. The programme is particularly notable for its mock computer animation sequences, actually produced by hand using traditional cel animation techniques. There have been several different edits of the series: Some, but not all, [[PBS]] stations recut the series into seven 30-minute episodes (when PBS member stations began transmitting the episodes nearly two years later, in December [[1982]]). Other PBS stations did a re-edit into "TV movies" (broadcasting more than one episode at a time without interruption). The UK videotape release was on two tapes - both consisting of three episodes edited to run together, also adding some previously unseen material and remixed the soundtrack into stereo (the North American VHS tape release by CBS-Fox Home Video included this material on a single videocassette). The DVD edition claims to be the final and definitive version of the six TV episodes.
[[Image:Mark_Wing-Davey_as_Zaphod_Beeblebrox.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Mark Wing-Davey]] as [[Zaphod Beeblebrox]] with animatronic second head and third arm.]]

Another production problem was that, being a visual adaptation, a solution had to be found to display Zaphod's three arms and two heads (a joke originally written for radio). In a previous stage adaptation, a version of the "pantomime horse" was used, where two actors filled one costume, providing three arms and two heads between them. For this TV series, an [[animatronic]] head was designed and built, incorporating twelve servos and two radio-controlled receivers.  However, the head was unreliable and in many scenes merely sits there, inanimate.  For the third arm, most of the time it was "seen" tucked into Zaphod's jacket. But when called for, Mike Kelt, who had designed the extra head, would hide behind [[Mark Wing-Davey]] and slip a third arm into the appropriate sleeve.

Other elements to the production were done by a variety of BBC designers. The ''[[Heart of Gold (spaceship)|Heart of Gold]]'' and "B Ark" models were built by [[Perry Brahan]]. The "small, furry creature from Alpha Centauri" in episode three was a puppet designed and controlled by [[Jim Francis]]. Jim Francis also built the Magrathean bubble car, also seen in episode three (and was the stunt double for [[Richard Vernon]] for the scene in which the bubble car was seen to fly). Matte Paintings throughout the series were created by [[Jean Peyre]]. Music and sound effects were by [[Paddy Kingsland]], with the exception of the theme music. The familiar ''[[One of These Nights|Journey of the Sorcerer]]'' theme, by [[Bernie Leadon]], was used again, in the arrangement by [[Tim Souster]] that had previously been used for the ''Hitchhiker's'' LP. Video effects using the Quantel system were done by [[Dave Jervis]]. Other puppets, including "insects" seen in Episode Five, were designed by [[Susan Moore (designer)|Susan Moore]]. Some of the actual puppeteering was done by [[Stuart Murdoch]], including operating parts of the "Dish of the Day" animal.

Two important cast changes were made for the TV version. [[David Dixon]] replaced [[Geoffrey McGivern]] as Ford, and [[Sandra Dickinson]] replaced [[Susan Sheridan]] as Trillian. The changes were made because McGivern did not suit the role visually, and [[Susan Sheridan]] was unavailable at the time. Another new cast member was [[Michael Cule]], who appears as the Vogon Guard in episode two. Michael had first appeared in one of the Hitchhiker's stage adaptations, performing no less than twelve roles, reprised the Vogon Guard part in the 1992 ''Making of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'' TV documentary (and voiced the Babel Fish), appeared in the 1994 photo illustrated edition of the book (as [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Mr. Prosser|Prosser]]), and returned a third time as a Vogon Guard for the [[BBC Radio 4]] ''Quandary Phase.''

=== Episode One ===
First Broadcast on [[BBC Two]], [[5 January]] [[1981]]

====Synopsis====

Episode One begins with a pre-credits sequence, the only one of the TV episodes to have one. A countdown to the end of the world is displayed through animation, and the narrator begins telling the story of the Guide and Arthur Dent's connection to it as the sun rises over the English countryside for the final time. Arthur wakes, discovers the threat to his house from a yellow bulldozer by looking out the window, and the camera pulls back to the credits. This episode closely follows the plot and dialogue of the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Primary and Secondary Phases#Fit the First|first episode of the radio series]], cutting the speech by Lady Cynthia Fitzmelton.  It ends at a slightly earlier point than the radio episode, after Ford's line "he might want to read us some of his poetry first", and on a cliffhanger that Arthur and Ford are about to be discovered in a Vogon storeroom, but before the [[Vogon poetry]] is actually read.

First Broadcast on BBC Two, [[12 January]] [[1981]]

====Synopsis====

The episode opens with a recap of the story, with Ford and Arthur about to be captured.  After being read Vogon poetry, they are thrown out of an airlock and improbably rescued by the Starship ''[[Heart of Gold (spaceship)|Heart of Gold]]'', which has been stolen by Ford's semi-cousin [[Zaphod Beeblebrox]], accompanied by [[Trillian (character)|Trillian]], a young woman who Arthur once met at a party.  Ford and Arthur are escorted to the bridge by [[Marvin the Paranoid Android]] and meet Zaphod and Trillian.  The episode ends after they are introduced, with no cliffhanger.

=== Episode Three ===
First Broadcast on BBC Two, [[19 January]] [[1981]]

====Synopsis====

The episode opens with a guide entry explaining the legendary planet of [[Places in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Magrathea|Magrathea]], which manufactured planets millions of years ago, until the Galactic economy collapsed.  Zaphod has been explaining to Ford that he has found the legendary planet of Magrathea, whilst Trillian tends to a pair of white mice.  Zaphod orders the computer to land on the planet surface.

Before long, they receive a transmission from the Commercial Council of Magrathea, informing them that the planet is closed for business and asking them to leave.  They ignore this and later receive another message, noting that nuclear missiles have been sent at the ship.  Attempts to evade the missiles fail, and Arthur uses the ship's [[Infinite Improbability Drive]], which ends up turning the missiles into a very surprised looking whale and a [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Agrajag|bowl of petunias]].  Trillian discovers that during the chaos, her mice escaped.

The five characters go onto the surface, where they find it desolate.  Zaphod suggests they lived inside the surface.  They split into two groups - Trillian, Zaphod and Ford explore a tunnel, whilst Arthur and Marvin remain on the surface.  Trillian, Zaphod and Ford's thread ends on a cliff-hanger, with them seeing something alarming at the end of the corridor.

Meanwhile, Arthur and Marvin watch the sunset.  Eventually, [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Slartibartfast|Slartibartfast]] arrives, and asks Arthur to come with him.  He explains that the Magratheans were in hibernation for the last five million years.  They get into his air-car, and descend deep into a tunnel.

A guide narrative intervenes, explaining that whilst humanity had always assumed that it was the most intelligent species on Earth, in fact the [[dolphin]]s were more intelligent, and had left the planet some time before.  However, both the dolphins and humans were less intelligent than the [[mouse|mice]].

Meanwhile, Slartibartfast shows Arthur the vast tract of hyperspace that acts as the Magrathean's "factory floor", and that they have  been brought out of hibernation for a special commission &mdash; "the Earth Mk 2, we're making a copy from our original blueprints".  The Earth was originally made by Magrathea for mice; and it was destroyed five minutes too early.  The episode ends here.

First Broadcast on BBC Two, [[26 January]] [[1981]]
[[Image:H2G2 CBSFOX VHS front.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Front cover of the North American VHS release of the TV series]]
====Synopsis====
Slartibartfast shows Arthur the archive tapes of Deep Thought being given the "Search for the Ultimate Answer" and of the result reported by the computer seven and a half million years later. After learning that the Earth was set up to search for the "Ultimate Question", Slartibartfast and Arthur join Ford, Trillian, Zaphod, and Trillian's mice, who had guided them to Magrathea.

The mice dismiss Slartibartfast, then express their desire to extract the "Ultimate Question" by first extracting Arthur's brain. While the mice attempt to strike a deal, the Galactic Police arrive, and Ford, Arthur, Trillian and Zaphod flee the dining hall, only to be cornered by the police in a large bay. After a misunderstanding, the police continue to fire on a computer bank behind which the four are hiding, which explodes, ending the episode on a cliffhanger.

:'''''Note:''''' The part of "Loon-Quall," one of the two computer programmers who hears Deep Thought announce "The Answer," is stated by the DVD production notes as being played by David Leland.

== Possibility of second series ==

A second series was at one point planned, with a storyline, according to [[Alan Bell]] and [[Mark Wing-Davey]], that would have come from Adams' abandoned ''Doctor Who and the Krikkitmen'' project (instead of a TV version of the second radio series). However, Adams got into disputes with the BBC (accounts differ: problems with budget, scripts, and having Alan Bell and/or [[Geoffrey Perkins]] involved are all offered as causes), and the second series was never made.<ref name="PocketTV">Simpson, ''The Pocket Essential Hitchhiker's Guide''. Page 96</ref><ref>{{cite book | author=[[Neil Gaiman|Gaiman, Neil]] | title=Don't Panic: Douglas Adams and the "Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" | publisher=Titan Books | year=2003 | id=ISBN 1-84023-742-2 |pages=Page 98}}</ref> The elements of the ''Doctor Who and the Krikketmen'' project instead became the third novel, ''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]''.

== Trivia ==
*Because of the sheer number of models used in episodes 2-6, a single day of filming just the model sequences was set aside at the BBC's Television Centre on [[28 October]] [[1980]]. This has been described as "a luxury few other shows could afford."
*In order to provide proper timing of spoken lines on-set, [[Douglas Adams]] himself spoke the lines of Eddie the Computer and Deep Thought, until they were redubbed by [[David Tate]] and [[Valentine Dyall]] respectively.
*The spaceman, suspended from a wire, in the titles sequence was [[Alan Harris]].
*Douglas Adams has several cameo appearances in the TV series.
**Episode 1: One of the drinkers in the background of the pub.
**Episode 2: The man who walks naked into the ocean.
**Episode 2: The Guide entry on "The Worst Poetry" also used Adams's likeness as the basis for the illustration of [[Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings]].
**Episode 3: An image in a guide entry on stress (along with animator Rod Lord, who provided a self-portrait).
**Episode 4: An image in a guide entry on the Marketing Division of the Sirius Cybernetics Corporation.
*Locations for filming included a clay pit and a former railway tunnel in Cornwall, the Edmonds Farm and Red Lion pub in Sussex, the Budgemoor Golf & Country Club near Henley-on-Thames, and the Peak District National Park.
*Episode Three was originally scripted to have a "pre-credits sequence" where Trillian announces their arrival at "the most improbable planet that ever existed" (i.e. Magrathea) to Zaphod. This was never filmed.
*The arrangement of "Journey of the Sorcerer" by [[Tim Souster]], used in the titles, was released as a single in the UK in January 1981. The "B Side" featured Douglas Adams playing rhythm guitar.
*Many of the costumes seen in Episodes One-Four can be seen again during sequences at Milliway's in Episode Five.
*The hand animated "computer graphics" of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide'' itself won a BAFTA award, a Design and Art Direction (D&AD) silver award, and a London Film Fest award.

== Documentary ==
[[Image:MakingOf H2G2 CBSFOX VHS front.jpg|right|100px]]

In [[1992]], [[Kevin Davies (director)|Kevin Davies]] wrote and directed a "making of" documentary entitled ''The Making of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.'' Davies had previously worked on the [[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Stage Shows|stage show at the Rainbow Theatre]], and, while working for [[Pierce Animation Studios]] in [[1980]], had introduced [[Alan Bell]] to [[Rod Lord]], leading to the animation for the TV series. For the documentary, Davies used many photographs and home movies he shot during the 1980 production of the series and recorded new interviews in October 1992 with the cast and crew. New footage of [[Simon Jones (actor)|Simon Jones]], [[David Dixon]] and [[Michael Cule]], in character, were shot at the farm used for [[Arthur Dent]]'s house in Sussex, and incorporated into the documentary. BBC video released the sixty minute documentary on VHS in [[1993]]. Footage not included in the original documentary was included in the [[2002]] DVD release of the series. The documentary itself has never (as of 2005) been actually transmitted on TV.<ref name="PocketTV"/>

== Video and DVD releases ==
[[Image:H2G2 DVD R2 Cover.jpg|thumb|right|130px|Front cover of BBC Video's Region 2 DVD release of the TV series]]

[[Neil Gaiman]] reveals in the first edition of his biography of [[Douglas Adams]], ''Don't Panic'', that the BBC was preparing a laserdisc release of the Hitchhiker's TV series in the mid-1980s, but had to cancel the project due to a legal tangle with the movie rights. BBC Video eventually was able to do an initial VHS release in 1992. This was a dual cassette edition, with "never before broadcast material" (that had been cut to shorten the episodes). CBS/Fox Home Video made the six episodes available on a single tape in North America starting in 1993. They were joined by "The Making of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy," also on VHS, that same year, as well as a laserdisc release. The complete series on one tape and the "Making of" on the second tape could also be purchased in a box set edition. Restoration of the six episodes and the "Making of" documentary were begun in 2001, with a Region 2+4 DVD release in the United Kingdom by BBC Video (Catalog Number BBCDVD 1092) in January 2002. A Region 1 edition, released by Warner Home Video, followed in April 2002. Both DVD editions are two-disc sets, with the six episodes on disc 1, and bonus materials on disc 2. The North American DVD edition also has a copy of the Omnibus tribute to Douglas Adams, from BBC 2, that aired on [[4 August]] [[2001]], which the UK DVD edition does not.
