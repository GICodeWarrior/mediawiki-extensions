# title = Robin Hood
# content

'''Robin Hood''' is a [[folk hero]]. A legendary person whom people
have told stories about for many years. Robin Hood is one who still
remains popular. His story has been featured in books, plays, movies
and cartoons as well.

In most stories Robin Hood is an [[outlaw]] who lives in [[Sherwood
Forest]] near the town of [[Nottingham, England]]. His arch-nemesises
are [[Prince John]], whom is temporarily on the throne because his
brother, [[King Richard the Lionhearted]] is off in the [[Middle
East]] fighting the [[Crusades]] and the corrupt [[Sheriff of
Nottingham]], who abuse their powers and take money from the innocent
and people who need it. Robin Hood uses his skills of archery and wits
to steal the money and give it back to the poor. Accompanying him are
his gang ([[The Merry Men]]), including [[Maid Marian]] (his
girlfriend), [[Little John]], and [[Friar Tuck]].

### title = Betty Ford
### content

'''Elizabeth Ann Bloomer Warren Ford''' (born [[April 8]], [[1918]])
is the [[wife]] of [[Gerald R. Ford]], the 38th [[President (United
States)|President of the United States]]. She acted as the [[First
Lady of the United States]] from [[1974]] to [[1977]].

Her birthplace is [[Chicago, Illinois]]. Her birth name was Betty
Bloomer. Her parents were Hortense Neahr and William Stephenson
Bloomer. She was the third child of her parents. She had two older
brothers named Robert and William, Jr. She spent her childhood in
[[Grand Rapids, Michigan]] and [[graduation|graduated from school
there. In 1935, she graduated in [[dance]] from the Calla Travis Dance
Studio. She gave dance [[lesson]]s to earn money during the [[Great
Depression]].

Betty Bloomer married William G. (Bill) Warren, a [[furniture]]
salesman. But the marriage did not last long. They divorced in 1947.

After that she started [[dating]] Gerald Ford. Ford was a good
[[football]] player at his college, and a graduate of the [[University
of Michigan]] and [[Yale Law School]]. They married on [[15 October]]
[[1948]].  The Fords have three sons and one daughter: *Michael Gerald
Ford (born 1950) - a [[minister]] *John Gardner "Jack" Ford (born
1952) - a [[journalist]] and [[public relations]] [[consultant]]
*Steven Meigs Ford (born 1956) - an [[actor]] and [[rodeo]] rider
*Susan Elizabeth (Ford) Vance Bales (born 1957) - a [[photographer]]

As of [[2005]], the Fords have seven grandchildren.

In 1974, [[President (United States)|President]] [[Richard Nixon]]
[[resignation|resigned]]. Nixon had named Gerald Ford as the [[Vice
President of the United States]]. After Nixon's resignation, Ford
became the 38th President of the United States.  Betty Ford became the
First Lady.

As the First Lady, Betty Ford played an active role. She spoke on many
issues. She spoke on [[politics|political]] and many other things. She
had an open mind, and spoke honestly about [[benefit]] of mild
[[psychiatric treatment]]. She also talked about [[marijuana]] use and
[[premarital sex]]. She always supported [[women's rights]]. Her
[[surgery]] for [[breast cancer]] made the public more aware of this
disease.

In [[1987]], Betty Ford found a place into the [[Michigan Women's Hall
of Fame]]. In [[1978]], she [[ppublished]] her [[autobiography]] ''The
Times of My Life''. In [[1999]], President Gerald Ford and Betty Ford
jointly got the [[Congressional Gold Medal]], "in recognition of their
dedicated [[public service]] and outstanding [[humanitarian]]
[[contribution]]s to the people of the United States of America."
[http://www.congressionalgoldmedal.com/GeraldandBettyFord.htm]

In [[2003]] Betty Ford published ''Healing and Hope: Six Women from
the Betty Ford Center Share Their Powerful Journeys of Addiction and
Recovery''.

As of 2005, she remains the active [[Chairman]] of the [[board of
directors|Board of Directors]] of the Betty Ford Center.

''the following are ideas, not yet policy''

There is little [[brilliant prose]] yet in the [[Simple English
Wikipedia]], but it is never too early to set high standards.  To
nominate an article, simply add it below.

Some criteria which apply to the article not relevant to Full English:

*Any word not on a reasonable [[defining vocabulary]] list of [[2000
words]] should be linked to its own article or to the [[Simple English
Wiktionary]] ([[wiktionary:Main Page|here).  Which is better is still
under debate.

*There should be no run-on sentences - this is much more important in
[[Simple English]].  Substitute two shorter ones.

*The article should deal sensitively and fully with common concerns of
the Simple English Users most likely to take an interest in it.
Unlike the Full English articles, the ones in Simple are much more
likely to be used as examples in classes in non-English-speaking
nations.  Where something uncomfortable has to be said, it should be
said with references and links to other more specific articles.  It
should never give the impression that it was written from a
condescending or patronising [[point of view]].  It should be
carefully vetted for any trace of [[racism]] or implied assumption of
superiority of cultures.

If you have any objection at all to the article being listed as
[[Brilliant Prose]], just remove it from the list.  No explanation at
all is ever required. Or you improve the article so that the
objections no longer apply.

----------

Candidates (with the first date that a non-author nominated them) are:

* [[History of Australia]] (once it's wikified) [[User:Angela|Angela]] 02:34, 18 Dec 2003 (UTC)  
** Agreed.  It looks somewhat wikified now... worth adding to the [[Brilliant Prose]] page? [[User:Sj|Sj]] 11:13, 13 Mar 2004 (UTC)

[[James Clark Maxwell]] found in [[1868]] four equations to describe all phenonemas of [[electromagnetism]]:

and

: <math>\nabla \cdot</math> is the [[divergence]] [[operator]] (SI unit: 1 per metre), 

: <math>\nabla \times</math> is the [[curl]] operator (SI unit: 1 per metre).

==The meaning of the equations==

=== Charge density and the electric field ===

: <math>\nabla \cdot \mathbf{D} = \rho</math>,

where <math>{\rho}</math> is the ''free'' electric charge density (in
units of C/m<sup>3</sup>), not including dipole charges bound in a
material, and <math>\mathbf{D}</math> is the [[electric displacement
field]] (in units of C/m<sup>2</sup>). This equation corresponds to
[[Coulomb's law]] for stationary charges in vacuum.

The equivalent integral form (by the [[divergence theorem]]), also known as Gauss' law, is:

: <math>\oint_A \mathbf{D} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = Q_\mbox{enclosed}</math>

where <math>d\mathbf{A}</math> is the area of a differential square on
the closed surface A with an outward facing surface normal defining
its direction, and <math>Q_\mbox{enclosed}</math> is the free charge
enclosed by the surface.

In a ''linear material'', <math>\mathbf{D}</math> is directly related
to the electric field <math>\mathbf{E}</math> via a material-dependent
constant called the [[permittivity]], <math>\epsilon</math>:

:<math>\mathbf{D} = \varepsilon \mathbf{E}</math>.

Any material can be treated as linear, as long as the electric field
is not extremely strong.  The permittivity of free space is referred
to as <math>\epsilon_0</math>, and appears in:

:<math>\nabla \cdot \mathbf{E} = \frac{\rho_t}{\varepsilon_0}</math>

where, again, <math>\mathbf{E}</math> is the electric field (in units
of V/m), <math>\rho_t</math> is the total charge density (including
bound charges), and <math>\epsilon_0</math> (approximately 8.854 pF/m)
is the permittivity of free space.  <math>\epsilon</math> can also be
written as <math>\varepsilon_0 \cdot \varepsilon_r</math>, where
<math>\epsilon_r</math> is the material's relative permittivity or its
''[[dielectric constant]]''.

Compare [[Poisson's equation]].

=== The structure of the magnetic field ===

:<math>\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0</math>

<math>\mathbf{B}</math> is the magnetic flux density (in units of
teslas, T), also called the magnetic induction.

Equivalent integral form: 

: <math>\oint_A \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{A} = 0</math>

<math>d\mathbf{A}</math> is the area of a differential square on the
surface <math>A</math> with an outward facing surface normal defining
its direction.

This equation only works if the integral is done over a closed
surface.  This equation says, that in every volume the sum of the
incoming magnetic field lines equuals the sum of the outgoing
magnetical field lines. This means that the magnetic field lines must
be closed loops. Another way of putting it is that the field lines
cannot originate from somewhere.  Mathematically formulated: "There
are no [[magnetic monopole]]s".

=== A changing magnetic flux and the electric field ===

: <math>\nabla \times \mathbf{E} = -\frac {\partial \mathbf{B}}{\partial t}</math>

Equivalent integral Form:

: <math> \oint_{s} \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{s} - \oint_s \mathbf{B}
\times \mathbf {v} \cdot d \mathbf{l} = - \frac {d\Phi_{\mathbf{B}}}
{dt}</math> where <math> \Phi_{\mathbf{B}} = \int_{A} \mathbf{B} \cdot
d\mathbf{A}</math>

where

&Phi;<sub><b>B</b></sub> is the magnetic flux through the area A described by the second equation

<b>E</b> is the electric field generated by the magnetic flux

<b>s</b> is a closed path in which current is induced, such as a wire

<b>v</b> is the instantaneous velocity of the line element (for moving circuits).

The [[electromotive force]] (sometimes denoted <math>\mathcal{E}</math>, not to be confused with the permittivity above) is equal to the value of this integral.

This law corresponds to the Faraday's law of [[electromagnetic induction]].

Some textbooks show the right hand sign of the Integral form with an
''N'' (representing the number of coils of wire that are around the
edge of ''A'') in front of the flux derivative. The ''N'' can be taken
care of in calculating ''A'' (multiple wire coils means multiple
surfaces for the flux to go through), and it is an engineering detail
so it has been omitted here.

The negative sign is necessary to maintain conservation of energy. It
is so important that it even has its own name, [[Lenz's law]].

This equation relates the electric and magnetic fields. This equation
e.g. describes how [[electric motor]]s and [[electric generator]]s
work. In a motor or generator, the fixed excitation is provided by the
[[Field (physics)|field]] circuit and the varying voltage is measured
across the [[armature (electrical engineering)|armature]] circuit.
Maxwell's equations apply to a right-handed coordinate system. To
apply them unmodified to a left handed system would mean a reversal of
polarity of magnetic fields (not inconsistent, but confusingly against
convention).

=== The source of the magnetic field ===

:<math> \nabla \times \mathbf{H} = \mathbf{J} + \frac {\partial \mathbf{D}} {\partial t}</math>

where <b>H</b> is the [[magnetic field strength]] (in units of A/m),
related to the magnetic flux <b>B</b> by a constant called the
[[Permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]], &mu; (<b>B</b> =
&mu;<b>H</b>), and <b>J</b> is the '''current density''', defined by:
<b>J</b> = &int;&rho;<sub>q</sub><b>v</b>dV where <b>v</b> is a vector
field called the drift velocity that describes the velocities of that
charge carriers which have a density described by the scalar function
&rho;<sub>q</sub>.

In free space, the permeability &mu; is the permeability of free
space, &mu;<sub>0</sub>, which is defined to be <em>exactly</em>
4&pi;&times;10<sup>-7</sup> W/A·m.  Also, the permittivity becomes the
permittivity of free space &epsilon;<sub>0</sub>.  Thus, in free
space, the equation becomes:

:<math>\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0 \mathbf{J} + \mu_0\varepsilon_0  \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t}</math>

Equivalent integral form:

:<math>\oint_s \mathbf{B} \cdot d\mathbf{s} = \mu_0 I_\mbox{encircled} + \mu_0\varepsilon_0  \int_A \frac{\partial \mathbf{E}}{\partial t} \cdot d \mathbf{A}</math>

''s'' is the edge of the open surface ''A'' (any surface with the
curve ''s'' as its edge will do), and ''I''<sub>encircled</sub> is the
current encircled by the curve ''s'' (the current through any surface
is defined by the equation: ''I''<sub>through ''A''</sub> =
&int;''<sub>A</sub><b>J</b>·d<b>A</b>).''

If the [[electric flux density]] does not vary rapidly, the second
term on the right hand side (the displacement flux) is negligible, and
the equation reduces to [[Ampère's law|Ampere's law]].

==Covariant Formulation==

There are only two covariant Maxwell Equations, because the covariant
field vector includes the electrical and the magnetical field.


''Mathematical note: In this section the [[abstract index notation]] will be used.''

In special relativity, in order to more clearly express the fact that
Maxwell's equations (in vacuum) take the same form in any inertial
coordinate system, the vacuum Maxwell's equations are written in terms
of [[four-vector]]s and tensors in the "manifestly covariant" form:

:<math>J^ b = \partial_a F^{ab} \,\!</math>,

and

:<math>0 = \partial_c F_{ab} + \partial_b F_{ca} + \partial_a F_{bc}</math>

the last of which is equivalent to:
:<math>0 = \epsilon_{dabc}\partial^a F^{bc} \,\! </math>

where <math>\, J^a</math> is the [[4-current]], <math>\, F^{ab}</math>
is the [[electromagnetic tensor|field strength tensor]] (written as a
4 &times; 4 [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]]), <math>\,
\epsilon_{abcd}</math> is the [[Levi-Civita symbol]], and
<math>\partial_a = (\partial/\partial ct, \nabla)</math> is the
4-gradient (so that <math>\partial_a \partial^a</math> is the
[[d'Alembertian]] operator).  (The <math>a</math> in the first
equation is implicitly summed over, according to [[Einstein
notation]].) The first tensor equation expresses the two inhomogeneous
Maxwell's equations: Gauss' law and Ampere's law with Maxwell's
correction.  The second equation expresses the other two, homogenous
equations: Faraday's law of induction and the absence of [[magnetic
monopole]]s.

More explicitly, <math>J^a = \, (c \rho, \vec J) </math> (as a
[[contravariant vector]]), in terms of the charge density &rho; and
the current density <math>\vec J</math>.  The 4-current satisfies the
continuity equation

<math>J^a{}_{,a} \, = 0</math>

In terms of the [[4-potential]] (as a contravariant vector)
<math>A^{a} = \left(\phi, \vec A c \right)</math>, where &phi; is the
electric potential and <math>\vec A</math> is the magnetic vector
potential in the Lorenz gauge <math>\left ( \partial_a A^a = 0 \right
)</math>, ''F'' can be expressed as:

:<math>F^{ab} = \partial^b A^a - \partial^a A^b \,\!</math>

which leads to the 4 &times; 4 matrix rank-2 tensor:

:<math>F^{ab} = \left(
\begin{matrix}
0 & -\frac {E_x}{c} & -\frac {E_y}{c} & -\frac {E_z}{c} \\
\frac{E_x}{c} & 0 & -B_z & B_y \\
\frac{E_y}{c}  & B_z & 0 & -B_x \\
\frac{E_z}{c} & -B_y & B_x & 0
\end{matrix}
\right) .</math>

The fact that both electric and magnetic fields are combined into a
single tensor expresses the fact that, according to relativity, both
of these are different aspects of the same thing&mdash;by changing
frames of reference, what seemed to be an electric field in one frame
can appear as a magnetic field in another frame, and vice versa.

Using the tensor form of Maxwell's equations, the first equation implies 

<math>\Box F^{ab} = 0</math> (See [[Electromagnetic four-potential]]
for the relationship between the d'Alembertian of the four-potential
and the four-current, expressed in terms of the older vector operator
notation).

Different authors sometimes employ different sign conventions for the
above tensors and 4-vectors (which does not affect the physical
interpretation).

<math>\, F^{ab}</math> and <math>\, F_{ab}</math> are ''not'' the
same: they are related by the [[Minkowski metric]] tensor
<math>\eta</math>: <math>F_{ab} =\, \eta_{ac} \eta_{bd}
F^{cd}</math>. This introduces sign changes in some of ''F'''s
components; more complex metric dualities are encountered in [[general
relativity]].

==Education and early works== 

[[Image:Douglas Adams Sign from HH cover.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Douglas
Adams was known to some fans as ''Bop Ad'' - after his illegible
signature]]Adams first attended Primrose Hill Primary School in
Brentwood. He took the exams and interviewed for [[Brentwood School
(England)|Brentwood School]] at age six, and attended the
[[Preparatory school (UK)|preparatory school]] from 1959 to 1964, then
the main school until 1970. He was in the top stream, and specialised
in the arts in the sixth form, after which he stayed an extra term in
a special seventh form class, customary in the school for those
preparing for [[Oxbridge]] entrance exams.

While at the prep school, his English teacher, Frank Halford, reportedly 
awarded Adams the only ten out of ten of his entire teaching career for a 
creative writing exercise.<ref>http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A3790659</ref> 
Adams remembered this for the rest of his life, especially when facing writer's 
block.<ref>{{cite book | author=Adams, Douglas | title=The Salmon of Doubt: 
Hitchhiking the Galaxy One Last Time | edition=US mass market paperback edition | 
publisher=Ballantine | year=2005 | pages=Page xix | id=ISBN 0-345-45529-0}}</ref> 
Some of Adams' earliest writing was published at the school, such as a report on 
the school's Photography Club in ''The Brentwoodian'' (in 1962) or spoof reviews 
in the school magazine ''Broadsheet'' (edited by [[Paul Neil Milne Johnstone]]). 
Adams also had a letter and short story published nationally in the UK in the boys' 
magazine ''The Eagle'' in 1965. He met [[Griff Rhys Jones]], who was in the year below, 
at the school, and was in the same class as "Stuckist" artist 
[[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]]; all three appeared together in 
a production of Shakespeare's Julius Caesar in 1968. He was six feet tall (1.83 m) 
by the time he was 12, and he stopped growing only at 6'5" (1.96 m). 
Later, he would often make self-ironic jokes about his own towering stature, 
"...the form-master wouldn't say 'Meet under the clock tower,' or 
'Meet under the War Memorial,' but 'Meet under Adams.'"

'''Aaliyah Dana Haughton'''<ref name="Aaliyah NNDB Profile"/>
([[January 16]], [[1979]] – [[August 25]], [[2001]]), known
professionally as '''Aaliyah''', was a [[Grammy Award]] winning
[[United States|American]] [[singer]], [[dancer]], [[Model
(person)|model]] and [[actress]]. Introduced to audiences by R&B
singer [[R. Kelly]], Aaliyah became famous during the mid-1990s with
several hit records from the songwriting/production team of [[Missy
Elliott]] & [[Timbaland]] and their associate [[Steve "Static"
Garrett]]. Aaliyah soon joined Timbaland's R&B and hip hop collective,
the [[Superfriends Clique]].

Notable for recording several hit records, including several number
one R&B hits, a number one pop hit, and nine top 10 singles on the
[[Billboard Hot 100]]. She also modeled for [[Tommy Hilfiger]] and
starred in two [[motion pictures]] before dying in a plane crash in
[[the Bahamas]].

==Early years== Aaliyah Dana Haughton was born in Bedford Stuyvesant,
Brooklyn, New York on January 16, 1979 to Michael and Diane Haughton,
and was raised in Detroit, Michigan. Her name means "Highest, Most
Exalted, The Best" in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] or "to ascend" in
[[Hebrew]].  Aaliyah was brought up as a [[Catholic]] with her older
brother [[Rashad Haughton]]. Her grandmother, Mintis L. Hicks
Hankerson, was of [[African American]] and [[Native Americans in the
United States|Native American]] descent. Diane Haughton, Aaliyah's
mother, also a vocalist, encouraged her daughter's career. Her uncle,
[[Barry Hankerson]], is a prominent individual in the music industry
and Aaliyah's aunt, through marriage to Hankerson, is [[Gladys
Knight]], a legendary soul singer with [[Gladys Knight & the Pips]].

She appeared on the TV talent show ''Star Search'' at age ten, singing
her mother's favorite song, "My Funny Valentine".  Although she did
not win, Aaliyah worked with an agent in New York and began to attend
auditions for TV shows, including ''[[Family Matters (TV
series)|Family Matters]]''.

Following her appearance on ''Star Search'' Aaliyah performed on stage
in [[Las Vegas]] with Gladys Knight. In her early teens, Aaliyah
attended the Detroit High School for the Fine and Performing Arts, and
graduated as a dance major with a 4.0 GPA

==''Age Ain't Nothing But a Number'' (1994)==
[[Image:Aaliyah-age-aint-94.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Cover of ''[[Age
Ain't Nothing but a Number]]''.]]  Aaliyah signed with her uncle
[[Barry Hankerson]]'s [[Blackground Records]] label in 1993 at the age
of 14. She released her debut album, titled ''[[Age Ain't Nothing but
a Number]]'', in 1994 at the age of 15. [[R. Kelly]], Aaliyah's then
alleged husband, was a leading songwriter and producer on her debut
album. The album displayed her smooth and velvety vocals and the
production work was said to be original and innovative. The album went
[[platinum album|platinum]] within months. The album featured the
gold-selling singles "[[Back and Forth (Aaliyah song)|Back and
Forth]]" (#1 U.S. R&B, 3 weeks and #5 [[Hot 100]] ), "[[At Your
Best]]" (#2 U.S. R&B and #6 [[Hot 100]] ), a cover of [[The Isley
Brothers]]' 1976 song, the album-titled single "[[Age Ain't Nothing
But A Number (song)|Age Ain't Nothing But A Number]]" (#75 [[Hot 100]]
and #35 US R&B, 2 weeks), and "Down with the Clique" (#33 UK Top 75
Singles). "Back and Fourth" was sampled by [[Madonna
(entertainer)|Madonna]] for the track, "[[Inside of Me]]" which
appears on her 1994 album ''[[Bedtime Stories]]''.  In June 1995,
Aaliyah released another single to radio only, "No One Knows How to
Love Me Quite Like You Do." The album has sold over 3.5 million copies
in the U.S. to date and nearly 7 million worldwide.

In 1994, a rumour surfaced that 15-year-old Aaliyah and 27-year-old
R. Kelly had secretly married in the state of [[Illinois]].  Both
initially denied. Although many websites and television shows claimed
that they found a marriage certificate, it never has been truly proven
that R. Kelly and Aaliyah have ever been married.

==Guest appearances, movie roles and soundtracks (1995 - 2001)==
[[Image:romeo must die dvd.jpg|150px|left|thumb|Aaliyah on the cover
of her first film ''[[Romeo Must Die]] {{speedy-image-c}}'' alongside
[[Jet Li]]]] In 1995 at age 16, Aaliyah performed "[[The Star-Spangled
Banner]]" live at an [[Orlando Magic]] basketball game.  Also during
that year, she appeared on the soundtrack for ''[[A Low Down Dirty
Shame]]'' with the minor international hit "The Thing I Like" (#33
UK). The song was also included on international versions of [[Age
Ain't Nothing But A Number]].

In 1997, Aaliyah appeared on the soundtrack album for the [[Fox
Animation Studios]] animated feature ''[[Anastasia (1997
movie)|Anastasia]]'', singing the pop version of "[[Journey to the
Past]]". The song was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy
Award]], and Aaliyah performed the song at the 1998 Academy Awards
ceremony, becoming the youngest female recording artist to perform at
the ceremony. Not only was Aaliyah the youngest female to perform but
she was the youngest African American to have the nominee for
[[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]].

Aaliyah had a hit in 1998 with "[[Are You that Somebody]]" (number one
airplay U.S.  eight weeks), the main single from the ''[[Dr. Dolittle
(film)|Dr. Dolittle]]'' soundtrack. Its video was the third
most-played on [[MTV]] that year, and the song's success helped make
Aaliyah a household name (and making her crowned as Queen of Urban
Pop).

In 2000, she co-starred with [[Jet Li]] in the [[martial arts]] film
''[[Romeo Must Die]]'', which debuted at number one at the box
office. Aaliyah and Timbaland executive produced the film's soundtrack
album and Aaliyah contributed four songs: "Are You Feelin' Me?," "I
Don't Wanna," "Come Back in One Piece," a duet with [[DMX
(rapper)|DMX]], and the international number one hit "[[Try Again]]."
Aaliyah made history once more when "Try Again" became the first song
to ever reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100 based solely on the
strength of its radio airplay, without any single sales factored
in. After the huge success of "Try Again" at radio, a [[12 inch
single|12" maxi single]] was released for consumer purchase. The
radio-only single, "I Don't Wanna", (which was also featured on the
soundtracks for the films ''[[Next Friday]]'' and ''Romeo Must Die'')
peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip Hop Singles &
Tracks chart.

In 2001, Aaliyah went to [[Australia]] to co-star with [[Stuart
Townsend]] in the film ''[[Queen of the Damned (film)|Queen of the
Damned]]'', an adaptation of the [[Anne Rice]] novel of the same
name. Aaliyah also recorded most of her third studio album,
''[[Aaliyah (album)|Aaliyah]]'', during this time.

==''One in a Million'' (1996)==
[[Image:aaliyah-one-in-a-million.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Cover of
''[[One in a Million (album)|One In A Million]]''.]]  ''[[One in a
Million (album)|One In A Million]]'', Aaliyah's sophomore album, was
chiefly written and produced by then unknowns [[Missy Elliott]] and
[[Timbaland|Timothy "Timbaland" Mosley]] and released on [[August
27]], [[1996]] when she was 17 years old. The album was a landmark in
Aaliyah's career, garnering her mass critical acclaim and introducing
Aaliyah's more mature side. It embarked the newfound chemistry of
Aaliyah and Timbaland. The album was certified double-platinum within
a year, making Aaliyah a major R&B star and igniting the successful
careers of Missy Elliott and Timbaland. ''One in a Million'' featured
the international smash hit "[[If Your Girl Only Knew]]" (number one
U.S. R&B, 2 weeks and #11 Hot 100), "[[One in a Million (Aaliyah
song)|One In A Million]]," (#1 U.S. R&B airplay, six weeks & #25 US
Hot 100 Airplay), the #8 U.S. R&B and #9 [[Hot 100]] single "[[The One
I Gave My Heart To]]," a ballad written by [[Diane Warren]], "[[4 Page
Letter]]" (#12 R&B Airplay), "[[Hot Like Fire (Timbaland Remix)|Hot
Like Fire]]" (two versions) (#31 R&B Airplay), and "[[Got to Give It
Up (Aaliyah song)|Got To Give It Up]](#37 UK)" (a remake of the
[[1977]] [[Marvin Gaye]] song).

[[Tommy Hilfiger]] gave Aaliyah her first endorsement deal. He signed
Aaliyah onto print campaigns, runway shows, and a commercial. During
this period, Aaliyah would also make guest appearances on albums by
artists such as [[Missy Elliott]], [[Timbaland & Magoo]], [[Ginuwine]]
and [[Playa (band)|Playa]]. [[Timbaland]] and [[Playa]]'s frontman
[[Steve "Static" Garrett]] would remain Aaliyah's principal
collaborators for the duration of her career. To date, ''One in a
Million'' has sold over 3.7 million copies in the U.S. and over 11
million worldwide.

After the success of ''One in a Million'', in 1997 Aaliyah headlined in her own tour "The Hot Like Fire Tour", in which she toured various major city venues performing hits from Her albums.

==''Aaliyah'' (2001)==
<!--[[Image:Aaliyah-ep-2001.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Cover of [[Aaliyah
(album)|Aaliyah]] commenting out image with no source/bad FairUse
claim--> "[[We Need a Resolution (Aaliyah song)|We Need a
Resolution]]," the first single from Aaliyah's third studio album, was
released [[April 24]], 2001 (see [[2001 in music]]). The self-titled
''[[Aaliyah (album)|Aaliyah]]'' was released three months later on
[[July 17]], [[2001]]. The album was an instant critical success but
sales were initially lower than expected, although they increased
considerably after her death. ''Aaliyah'' introduced a darker and
edgier side to Aaliyah's music and was noted as having showcased her
growth as an artist. Around the time of the album's recording and
release she had been filming ''Queen of the Damned'', which helped her
show a dark and edgy side as her character was a deadly villain. The
album debuted at number two on the [[Billboard 200]] chart, selling
190,000 copies in its first week, and was certified gold (500,000
copies sold) within four weeks, before her death. The week after the
plane crash it climbed to number one. [[Trent Reznor]] of [[Nine Inch
Nails]] was to produce a song on the album but scheduling conflicts
did not permit the collaboration.

==="More Than A Woman" and "Rock The Boat"=== 
There was no shortage of
confusion at the label regarding the next single from the Aaliyah
album. Aaliyah had been promoting "[[More Than a Woman (Aaliyah
song)|More Than a Woman]]", having performed it twice and shooting a
video with director Dave Meyers in the summer of 2001. According to
Blackground, a remix featuring State Property and Jay-Z was also
planned, but was scrapped due to lack of adequate funds. The video was
to be released but "[[Rock the Boat (Aaliyah song)|Rock the Boat]]"
began receiving huge amounts of radio-play, so she was immediately
sent to the Bahamas to shoot the video. The "[[Rock The Boat]]" music
video was put in the 106 and Park hall of fame, making the countdown
over 65 times and landed at #2 on [[BET]]'s Top 100 videos of
2001. "[[More Than a Woman]]" made the number-one spot after "Rock the
Boat" was retired. "Rock the Boat" was #2 U.S. R&B and #14 Hot 100
single. "I Care 4 U" was #3 U.S. R&B and #16 Hot 100 single. The album
went on to sell over 8 million copies worldwide.

==Death== 
On August 25, 2001, at 6:49 pm, just after wrapping up
filming of the "Rock the Boat" video, Aaliyah and various members of
her record company boarded a twin engine [[Cessna 402]]B (N8097W) at
Marsh Harbour, Abaco Island, Bahamas to travel to Opa-locka Airport
near Miami, Florida, but the plane crashed shortly after takeoff about
200 feet from the runway. Pilot Luis Morales III and all eight
passengers, including Aaliyah, were killed in the aviation
incident. According to findings from an inquest conducted by the
coroner's office in the Bahamas, Aaliyah suffered from "severe burns
and a blow to the head," in addition to severe shock. The coroner
theorized that, even if Aaliyah survived the crash, her recovery would
have been virtually impossible given the severity of her
injuries.<ref>[http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/2003/11/21/aaliyah.htm
Bahamas Coroner delivers verdict in Aaliyah death crash.] (2003,
November 21). ''Caribbean News''. Retrieved February 9, 2007.</ref>

Aaliyah's eulogy was held on August 31 at Saint Ignatius Loyola Roman
Catholic Church on East 84th Street in Manhattan. A horse-drawn
carriage then carried her coffin to [[Ferncliff Cemetery]] in
Hartsdale, New York, where she was initially interred in a crypt in
the extension wing of the main mausoleum. When the Rosewood Mausoleum
was completed a couple of years later, Aaliyah was moved to a private
room in the new building. The inscription of her alias ''Baby Girl''
is engraved on her crypt.

===Investigation===
{{Copypaste}}

NTSB reports indicate that the pilot, Luis Morales III, was not
qualified to pilot the plane he was attempting to fly. Morales falsely
obtained his FAA license by showing hundreds of hours never flown, and
he may also have falsified how many hours he had flown in order to get
a job with his employer, Blackhawk International
Airways. Additionally, an autopsy performed on Morales revealed
cocaine and alcohol in his blood.

Further investigations determined the plane was over its total gross
weight by several hundred pounds. Although witnesses claimed that the
passengers had been asked to leave some luggage behind, it was later
discovered that the passengers, including Aaliyah, had not been
informed of the excess weight.

Eddie Golson, president of Pro Freight Cargo Services at Opa-locka
Airport, said workers carted "a pickup truck of freight" from the
crash site Monday. "That's absurd to think that this pilot got in this
airplane with eight other people and a truck full of freight and
expected this thing to fly," Golson said. "What the hell was going
on?" a baggage handler was reported to have said, in reaction to
hearing that no one weighed the passengers or baggage. Two of the
passengers, members of Aaliyah's entourage, weighed in the
neighborhood of 300 pounds and sat in the rear of the plane, where the
baggage was also stored.

The day of the aviation incident was Mr. Morales' first official day
with Blackhawk International Airways, a Part 135 single-pilot
operation. He had been employed with Golden Airlines, from which he
was fired only four hours before the fatal aviation incident. In
addition, Luis Morales III was not registered with the FAA to fly for
Blackhawk. As a result of the incident, a wrongful death lawsuit was
filed by Aaliyah’s parents and was later settled out of court for an
undisclosed amount.
 
Barry & Sons, Inc., a corporation formed in 1992 to develop, promote
and capitalize on the musical talents of Aaliyah and to oversee the
production and distribution of her records, tapes and music videos,
brought an unsuccessful lawsuit in the Supreme Court of the State of
New York against Instinct Productions LLC, (a company hired by Barry &
Sons, Inc. in August, 2001 to produce the "Rock the Boat" music
video). The case was dismissed since New York State's wrongful death
statute only permits certain people to recover damages for wrongful
death.<ref>[http://www.courts.state.ny.us/reporter/3dseries/2005/2005_00096.htm

==Legacy== 
"Rock the Boat" went on to become a [[Posthumous
work|posthumous]] hit on radio (reaching number two on Billboard's Hot
R&B Singles charts, number 14 on the Hot 100, and number 12 in the UK)
and video channels, and the news of Aaliyah's death gave her album a
notable sales boost, pushing it to number one on the Billboard
200. The album produced two other singles. "More than A Woman" reached
number 7 on Billboard's Hot R&B singles chart, number 25 on Hot 100,
and number one in the UK. "I Care 4 U" reached number three on
Billboard's Hot R&B singles chart and number 16 on the Hot 100, the
latter attaining success even without the promotional push of a
[[music video]].  The ''Aaliyah'' album went on to sell over 3 million
copies in the U.S. ''[[Queen of the Damned (film)|Queen of the
Damned]]'' was released in early 2002. Before its release, Aaliyah's
brother Rashad was called upon to re-dub several of his sister's lines
during the post-production [[Dubbing (music)|ADR]] process. Upon its
release, the film debuted at number one. The film was also dedicated
to her.

In 2001, Missy Elliott released her video for "[[Miss E... So
Addictive|Take Away]]".  The video contained words and images about
Aaliyah.  The single also featured Ginuwine and was the debut of
Elliott's recent protégé, [[Tweet (singer)|Tweet]].

Aaliyah and former [[The Beatles|Beatle]] [[George Harrison]] made UK
Chart History in January 2002 when they scored the first, and to this
date only, back-to-back posthumous number one hits (aside from the
[[Elvis Presley]] re-releases in 2005). Aaliyah's "More than a Woman",
released on January 7 and topped the chart on January 13, was followed
by Harrison's "My Sweet Lord", re-released on January 14 and topped
the chart on January 20. Aaliyah was voted one of "The Top 40 Woman of
the Video Era" in VH1's The Greatest, also ranked #36 on their list of
the 100 Sexiest Artist. Aaliyah also made E!'s list on the 101 Most
Shocking Moments in Entertainment, Juciest Hollywood Hookups, and Best
Kept Hollywood Secrets. Aaliyah recently ranked at #18 on BET's "Top
25 Dancers of All Time". In 2005, former Co-Star Jet-Li as reported
from CNN stated the memory of Aaliyah had haunted him in Vancouver,
where he and the late songstress shot the film [[Romeo Must Die]].

In addition Aaliyah has been the topic of five books: ''Aaliyah: More
than a Woman'' (2001) by Christopher John Farley, ''Aaliyah: An R&B
Princess in Words and Pictures'' (2002) by Kelly Kenyatta, ''Aaliyah''
by [[Tim Footman]] (2003), and ''Aaliyah Remembered: Her Life & The
Person behind the Mystique'' (2005) by William Sutherland.

===Unfinished Films===
Aaliyah was to have had a supporting role as Zee, the wife of [[Harold
Perrineau Jr.]]'s character, Link, in the two sequels to ''[[The
Matrix]]''. The directors initially tried to find a way to incorporate
her footage into the movies but decided against it due to lack of
material available. The role was recast with [[Nona Gaye]] playing the
character. Other films in which Aaliyah was signed to star in were
''[[Honey (2003 film)|Honey]]'' (which instead was filmed with
[[Jessica Alba]] as the main character), and a [[Whitney
Houston]]-produced remake of the 1976 film ''[[Sparkle (1976
film)|Sparkle]]'' (now in the works with [[Raven-Symoné]] as the main
character).

In addition, Aaliyah and one of her agents had pitched and signed a
deal with Fox Searchlight Pictures for her to star in a film based
upon a true story about interracial love.

==''I Care 4 U'' (2002)== 
[[Image:aaliyah icare4u.jpg|right|thumb|200
px|Cover of ''[[I Care 4 U]]''.]]  ''I Care 4 U'' was released by
Blackground Records on December 10, 2002. Along with her hit singles,
a number of previously unreleased tracks were included on the album,
including "[[Erica Kane]]", "Don't Worry" and "All I Need" and the new
singles "Miss You", "Don't Know What to Tell Ya", and "Come Over." ''I
Care 4 U'' debuted at an impressive #3 on the Billboard 200 and #1 on
the R&B album charts (where it remained for 7 weeks). The album went
on to sell over 2.6 million in the U.S. and 5 million worldwide.

The video for "Miss You" features [[Missy Elliott]], [[Toni Braxton]],
[[Lil' Kim]], [[Dallas Austin]], MTV presenter and close friend
[[Ananda Lewis]], actor/singer [[Jamie Foxx]], [[AJ Calloway]], [[Free
(rapper)|Free]], [[Quddus (MTV)|Quddus]], Missy's recent protegé and
longtime friend [[Tweet]], [[U-God]] (of the ''[[Wu-Tang Clan]]'') and
[[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], [[Rosario Dawson]], among others, paying tribute
to Aaliyah. Following her death, her single "[[Miss You (2003
song)|Miss You]]" made it to #1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|US R&B
Charts]]. The album earned Aaliyah a [[posthumous]] [[Grammy]] for
[[Best Instrumental Arrangment Accompanying Vocals]]

The follow-up single to "Miss You" was "[[Don't Know What to Tell
Ya]]". However it was only released in Europe and peaked at #22 in the
UK and #57 in Germany. The "Handcuff Remix" became popular among fans
who had bought the single. The third and final Single released (second
in the U.S.) was [[Come Over (Aaliyah song)|Come Over]]. The single
had moderate pop success peaking in the top 40 of The Hot 100 at
#32. It did a lot better on the R&B charts becoming a top 10 hit
peaking at #9.

Shortly after, the "Greatest Hits : Special Fan Box"
[http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0001GYH2A/ref=ord_cart_shr/202-2194674-4915813]
was released. It featured re-packaged versions of the albums "One In A
Million", "Aaliyah" and "I Care 4 U". It also featured a DVD
containing all of Aaliyah's music videos. It was all packaged in a
special box.

==Aaliyah in the mid-2000s==
In early/mid-2005, four previously unreleased Aaliyah tracks were
leaked to the Internet: a cover of [[Gladys Knight & the Pips|Gladys
Knight & the Pips']] "Giving Up", "Where Could He Be" featuring Missy
Elliot and Tweet (which was sent to radio stations), "Steady Ground"
featuring Static from Playa, and a duet with Digital Black from Playa
entitled "Don't Think They Know". In January 2006, a new unreleased
Aaliyah track was leaked to the Internet. Entitled "Time", it was a
snippet of an unfinished song and was produced by Timbaland (Sample of
this track can be found on YouTube) Buzz of a song titled
"Girlfriends" has been brewing for years now since the death of
Aaliyah, until recently [[Yaushameen Michael]] posted the song on her
Myspace, a Duet with the late R&B Princess. There are also many other
rumored unreleased tracks such as "Did You Hear", "Dont Think They
Know" feat. Digital Black, "Forever in My Heart", and "Candy".

==Merchandise and the Aaliyah Charity Fund==
Aaliyah's official website features items such as t-shirts with
Aaliyah's name on them. She has had a calendar with her pictures since
2002. In 2007, Aaliyah's mother Diane Haughton and former manager Paul
Allcata hired branding and licensing agency Wicked Cow Entertainment
to grow the Aaliyah licensing program. Plans are currently underway
for an apparel and accessories line.<ref>{{cite|The Licensing

Many [[religion]]s, [[philosophy|ways of thinking]], and creative artists have tried to fi
gure out the '''Meaning of Life'''. Some people say that we will never know what the meaning of life is. Many [[religion]]s
claim to offer some answers. There are also ways of thinking called philosophies which claim to offer some answers. There
are also artists who paint pictures to explain the meaning of life. As well, there are musicians who write and play music a
nd songs, and writers who write novels and stories to explain the meaning of life.

Many people from different religions or [[culture]]s have different opinions on what the meaning of life is. We may never find 
out who is right. Some people, called [[existentialism|existentialists]] believe there is no meaning of life, except the meaning 
that we make up for ourselves.

==Other meanings==

The phrase &quot;Meaning of Life&quot; is an important part of a novel called ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''

}} "For decades now, Arab terrorists operating out of southern Lebanon have staged raids and fired mortar shells into northern Israel, denying the Israelis peace of mind. In the early 1980s, the terrorists operating out of Lebanon were controlled by Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization (P.L.O.). After Israel's ambassador to Britain, Shlomo Argov, was shot in cold blood and seriously wounded by the Palestinian terror group Abu Nidal in London in 1982, fed-up Israelis sent tanks and troops rolling into Lebanon to disperse the guerrillas." (pg. 44-45)</ref><ref>"The Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) had been launching guerrilla attacks against Israel since the 1960s (see Palestine Liberation Organization). After the PLO was driven from Jordan in 1971, the organization established bases in southern Lebanon, from which it continued to attack Israel. In 1981 heavy PLO rocket fire on Israeli settlements led Israel to conduct air strikes in Lebanon. The Israelis also destroyed Iraq's nuclear reactor at Daura near Baghdad. 

In an attempt to destroy the PLO forces, Israel began bombing southern Lebanon and Beirut on June 5, 1982.

"Since 1970, Israeli settlements near the southern border of Lebanon had been exposed to harassing attacks from forces of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which had been driven out of Jordan. On three occasions, in 1970, 1972, and 1978, Israel had retaliated by ground operations carried out up to Lebanon's Litani River. ... Meanwhile Israel had conducted preemptive shelling and air strikes to deter PLO terrorist attacks on settlements in Galilee in northern Israel."</ref>

The '''1982 Lebanon War''' ({{lang-he|מלחמת לבנון}}, ''Milkhemet Levanon''), ({{lang-ar|''الإجتياح (Al-Ijtiah or the invasion)''}}), called by Israel the '''Operation Peace of the Galilee''' ({{lang-he|מבצע שלום הגליל, or מבצע של"ג ''Mivtsa Shlom HaGalil'' or ''Mivtsa Sheleg''}}), and later colloquially also known in Israel as the '''First Lebanon War''', began [[June 6]], [[1982]], when the [[Israel Defense Forces]] invaded [[southern Lebanon]]. The [[Politics of Israel|Government of Israel]] ordered the invasion as a response to the assassination attempt against Israel's ambassador to the [[United Kingdom]], [[Shlomo Argov]] by the [[Abu Nidal Organization]]. See also [[Operation Litani]].

After attacking [[PLO]], [[Syria]]n and [[Muslim]] [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] forces, Israel occupied southern Lebanon. Surrounded in West [[Beirut]] and subject to heavy bombardment, the [[PLO]] and the [[Syrian]] forces negotiated passage from Lebanon with the aid of international peacekeepers.
