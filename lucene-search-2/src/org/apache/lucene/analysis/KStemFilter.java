/** Transforms the token stream according to the KStem stemming algorithm.
 *  For more information about KStem see <a href="http://ciir.cs.umass.edu/pubfiles/ir-35.pdf">
    "Viewing Morphology as an Inference Process"</a>
    (Krovetz, R., Proceedings of the Sixteenth Annual International ACM SIGIR
    Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, 191-203, 1993).

    Note: the input to the stemming filter must already be in lower case,
    so you will need to use LowerCaseFilter or LowerCaseTokenizer farther
    down the Tokenizer chain in order for this to work properly!
    <P>
    To use this filter with other analyzers, you'll want to write an
    Analyzer class that sets up the TokenStream chain as you want it.
    To use this with LowerCaseTokenizer, for example, you'd write an
    analyzer like this:
    <P>
    <PRE>
    class MyAnalyzer extends Analyzer {
      public final TokenStream tokenStream(String fieldName, Reader reader) {
        return new KStemStemFilter(new LowerCaseTokenizer(reader));
      }
    }
    </PRE>
