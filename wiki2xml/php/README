=head1 NAME

WIKI2XML - Wikitext to XML converter

=head1 INSTALLATION

=head2 Download/Checkout

Check out the current release from SVN:

	svn co http://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/mediawiki/trunk/wiki2xml

=head2 Copy files

Copy the subdirectory C<< ./php/ >> to your server's C<< wiki/ >>
directory as a subdirectory named C<< w2x >>:

	htdocs
		\- wiki
			\- w2x				<-- here
				\- w2x.php
				\- wiki2xml.php		etc

=head2 Configuration

The configuration is stored in C<< default.php >> and C<< local.php >>.

There is a C<< sample_local.php >> file, copy it to C<< local.php >>
and then edit it to match your configuration.

On a Unix/Linux server the following can be used as a starting point:

	$xmlg["temp_dir"] = "/tmp"; 			# Directory for temporary files

	#$xmlg["zip_odt_path"] = ""; 			# Path to the zip/unzip programs; can be omitted
							# if in default execuatable path
	$xmlg["zip_odt"] = 'zip -r9 $1 $2';		# Command to zip directory $1 to file $2
	$xmlg["unzip_odt"] = 'unzip -x $1 -d $2'; 	# Command to unzip file $1 to directory $2
 
=head1 USAGE

Open the following in your browser:

	http://example.com/wiki/w2x/w2x.php

It should present you with a form with a textarea and several buttons.

=head1 TROUBLESHOOTING

If you get errors like the following:

	Warning: fopen(/tmp/ODD6Rq1qt-DIR/content.xml): failed to open stream:
	No such file or directory in /.../wiki/wiki2xml/w2x.php on line 112

then make sure that the tmp directory you selected is really writable by
your webserver.

=head2 OpenOffice Output

For OpenOffice output, the converter will extract a file called C<< template.odt >>
into the temp directory. It will then replace/modify the files in it, zip it
up again and then offer the browser the resulting file as a download.
