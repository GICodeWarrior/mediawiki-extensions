This directory contains the UDP-to-XMPP bridge, implemented by udp2xmpp.py.
This runs standalone as a python program, and does not interact wit the web
server. 

You can place this directory anywhere on your system. In fact, for security
reasons, it is recommended to move it to a location that is not accessible
from the web or by the web server.

To run udp2xmpp.py, you need python 2.5 and the xmpppy library from 
<http://xmpppy.sourceforge.net/>. You also need an account on an XMPP
(Jabber) server for use by udp2xmpp.py. 

In order to configure udp2xmpp for use with your wiki, rename 
udp2xmpp.ini.sample to udp2xmpp.ini. Put the credentials for your XMPP
account into udp2xmpp.ini and adjust it to your needs (see comments inside).

If you use UDP-to-XMPP with a single wiki, you can provide the necessary
information for this wiki directly in udp2xmpp.ini. Otherwise, you need to
rename  and udp2xmpp-wikis.ini.sample to udp2xmpp-wikis.ini and create one
section for each wiki in this file (see comments). The secions' names
must be the wiki IDs as returned by wfWikiID(). A wiki's ID is the name of
the database it uses ( $wgDBname ) plus, if applicable, the table prefix
( $wgDBname-$wgDBprefix ).

When everything is configured, you can start udp2xmpp.py simply by typing:

  python udp2xmpp.py

Since this is a long running process, it's advisable to put it into a
screen session.

udp2xmpp.py takes commands from standard input. Thes must start with "/":

  /quit terminates udp2xmpp
  /send ... sends a message to *all* channels
  /debug /verbose and /quiet set the noise level
