Hello,

One or more of your processes on the host %hostname%
were exceeding the configured memory limit, which is %limit% megabytes.
I have killed enough of your processes to bring your usage back to the
threshold limit, which is %thresh% megabytes.

These are the processes I killed:

%processes%

Your total memory usage is now %current% megabyte(s).

Excessive memory usage is usually a symptom of a broken program.  Please
investigate the cause of the problem and fix it before you restart these
processes.

Regards,
      slayerd (the process slayer)
