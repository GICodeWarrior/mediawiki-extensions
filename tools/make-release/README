== make-release.sh ==

Handy-dandy tool to pull a tagged release out of SVN and generate:
* a tarball
* a patch to previous revision (if >= x.x.1)
* GPG signatures for the above
* links & checksums for the release announcement

Usage:
  ./make-release.sh --snapshot
  ./make-release.sh 1.12.1


== upgradeTest.py ==

Checks out MediaWiki branches from 1.2 on up, to test upgrading from a fresh
database at each schema level.

Doesn't test all possible scenarios, but should catch gross regressions.

Currently a bit hacking. Requires SVN, PHP, MySQL on localhost, root w/ blank
password, and available space for databases 'uptest12'...'uptest15' etc.

WILL EAT ANY SUCH NAMED DATABASES YOU HAVE. BEWARE.
