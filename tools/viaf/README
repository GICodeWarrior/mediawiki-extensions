viaf.user.js, a Greasemonkey script
which detects VIAF numbers on web pages and creates related links

*** detailed information page will follow ***

Version: see viaf.user.js

The viaf.user.js script tries to generously detect VIAF numbers as part of a web
page's text, and also as part of links (urls).

Detected numbers are indicated with bright cyan colour to attract the
user's attention.

While detecting the numbers, the script adds new links to additional servers.

Such new links come in yellow and have the detected VIAF number as part of the
url, i.e. are deep links (single-click solution).

Those VIAF numbers which are only part of a url (i.e not in the text) are not
apparent without this script. Numbers as part of urls are treated in the same
way as numbers in the text. The script adds a dotted red underline to urls which
contain a VIAF which is detected by matching a magic regular expression
(see program code for details).

A summary box (6) lists all distinct VIAF numbers to facilitate cut & paste of
the extracted numbers; this can be disabled in the program code.

The set of further server urls can be adapted in the program code.
It relies on jQuery and two further javascripts, which are fetched automatically
and has an integrated update checker (currently disabled) which looks for newer
versions of it and prompts the user in such case.

It does not automatically install a newer version.
