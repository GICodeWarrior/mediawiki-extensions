$user[name],

As promised on wikitech-l (http://hexm.de/5u), I'm sending email to
all MediaWiki developers with any FIXME'd revisions.  I'll be sending
a reminder at least twice a week from now on for any outstanding
FIXMEs.

Link to all your FIXMEs:
http://mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:Code/MediaWiki/status/fixme?author=$author

$commits

Please address them as soon as possible.  When you think you've
addressed one, change its status field from "fixme" to "new" and make
sure your new revision shows up under "Follow-up revisions"

To mark a revision as follow-up to a previously committed revision
right at the time of committing, just put the previously committed
revision's number, prefixed by 'r', into your commit summary.

If you have any questions about this, then please feel free to email
me.

Thanks,

Mark
