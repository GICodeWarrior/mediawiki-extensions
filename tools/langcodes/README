This directory contains a few files I found useful when making language menus in Javascript.

The problem was that MediaWiki sorted the items in the language menu by the language code, but displayed languages by their
localized name. This meant that the languages were in effectively random order and were very difficult to find. Arabic was right
next to Austrian, and so on.

This perl script can sort by the unicode name, and then outputs a suitable fragment of a data structure for Javascript. You
may find it useful for PHP as well.

Problems:
  - At present there seem to be a lot of weird dupes and deprecated codes and other stuff which may not be good to include.
  - Some languages have needless Left-to-Right markers, which affects how they sort
  - A true lexicographic sort would probably look different (Cesky (Czech) should be up in the European scripts, not down among the Middle Eastern scripts)
