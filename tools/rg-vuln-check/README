This is a tool to check for the classic register_globals/url_fopen vulnerability
in any PHP script. Such a vulnerability looks like this:

<?php
require_once( "$IP/includes/SpecialPage.php" );
?>

When register_globals is enabled, an attacker can pass any value they like for
$IP, and when url_fopen is enabled, or if the server is Windows with SMB client
capabilities, the script can be fetched from a remote source, making this an
arbitrary script execution vulnerability.

This test script uses the parsekit extension to analyse a file and extract its 
referenced global variables. Then it invokes the file via a specially configured 
webserver, which has register_globals enabled. The script is invoked with a 
value for each global in turn, and the output is analysed for evidence of XSS 
and inclusion vulnerabilities.

The configuration of the webserver should be appropriate for your level of trust
in the code you are testing. It might be open_basedir/safemode, chroot CGI or
a firewalled virtual server. The configuration variables register_globals and 
display_errors must be enabled for the tester to work, and open_basedir is 
recommended.
