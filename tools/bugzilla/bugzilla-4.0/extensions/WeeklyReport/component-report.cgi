# Bryce Nesbitt <bryce@nextbus.COM>,
#    Added -All- report, change "nobanner" to "banner" (it is strange to have a
#    list with 2 positive and 1 negative choice), default links on, add show
#    sql comment.
# Joe Robins <jmrobins@tgix.com>,
#    If using the usebuggroups parameter, users shouldn't be able to see
#    reports for products they don't have access to.
# Gervase Markham <gerv@gerv.net> and Adam Spiers <adam@spiers.net>
#    Added ability to chart any combination of resolutions/statuses.
#    Derive the choice of resolutions/statuses from the -All- data file
#    Removed hardcoded order of resolutions/statuses when reading from
#    daily stats file, so now works independently of collectstats.pl
#    version
#    Added image caching by date and datasets
# Myk Melez <myk@mozilla.org):
#    Implemented form field validation and reorganized code.
#
# Luis Villa <louie@ximian.com>:
#    modified it to report things in a new format
# Matt Rogers <mattr@kde.org>:
#    Rewritten for bugzilla 3.0 including template
