Hello! I'm Jimmy Wales, the Founder
of Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Wikipedia depends on the generous
donations of people from all over the world

3
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,250
People like you.

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,750
The Wikipedia project started back in
2001, and has very quickly become

5
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,000
one of the top-10 destinations on the Internet.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
English is the largest
language of Wikipedia, but

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,500
what about the languages
of the developing world?

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:34,000
We need to help foster the growth of
Wikipedias in such languages as

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Hindi, Arabic, and Swahili,

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
languages where the speakers will really
benefit from access to free knowledge.

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,000
The following is some footage from the independent
documentary film "Truth in Numbers"

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,750
When a child gets a laptop, there
is a snap-shot of the Wikipedia

13
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:54,250
both in their native language, and also
some of the English Wikipedia as well.

14
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,250
That they can engage in

15
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,250
a critical discourse with other people
about things that are out in the world,

16
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,500
that they don't have to take things at face
value - that's a powerful idea.

17
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,750
Part of the idea behind the the laptop is
to expose kids to powerful ideas, and the

18
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,000
Wikipedia is one of those powerful ideas.

19
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:17,000
Well, of course, my contribution is
just a bit, but every little bit helps.

20
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:25,000
So this is how I write in Wikipedia.
Yes, it's a lot of work, but it works! 

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,000
One day, we can put it on a disc and give it
around the schools, so people can look it up.

22
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:41,000
All of a sudden, Wikipedia came and then this,
the sum total of human knowledge - it struck me.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
You know the website Wikipedia?
Yeah, yeah.

24
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,750
So, I'm the Founder of Wikipedia.
Okay, hi! Nice to meet you! It's a great site ...

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,250
Do you ever look at the ... ?
... and I also use pick-up lines from that.

26
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,000
Pick-up lines! From Wikipedia?
Oh, yeah - did it work?

27
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,500
One of the things that I've done is I've
taken a copy of this whole website, 

28
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:18,000
which is Wikipedia, and I've put it in a computer
classroom where they don't have Internet access.

29
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:25,000
If more of this was available in
Afrikaans, it would be very useful.

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,750
Actually, it's more important for developing
countries than it is for developed countries, 

31
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:33,750
because there is a gap,
and this gap is purely knowledge

32
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,500
it's not money, it's not politics or
power or whatever, it's knowledge.

33
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:42,500
If we have the knowledge, and we know
how to use it, then the gap will be filled

34
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,500
and we can look to a brighter future.

35
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,500
Wikipedia has already changed the world,
and with your continued support

36
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:55,500
there's no telling how much we can do
for people internationally.

37
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Imagine a world
in which every single person on the planet 

38
00:02:59,001 --> 00:03:04,250
is given free access to
the sum of all human knowledge.
