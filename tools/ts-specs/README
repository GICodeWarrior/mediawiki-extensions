		Toolserver pkgbuild spec file repository
		========================================

Welcome to ts-specs.  This repository holds a number of spec files used to 
build Solaris packages for the Wikimedia Toolserver.  (While some of the specs  
might build on Linux using rpmbuild, this hasn't been tested.)

All these specs install in /opt/ts, with the following exceptions:

  * MySQL installs in /opt/TSmysql
  * PHP installs in /opt/php
  * GNU coreutils and GNU findutils install in /opt/gnu
  * OpenLDAP installs in /opt/TSopenldap
  * Exim installs in /opt/exim

To build a package, use pkgtool:

  $ pkgtool -v build --download TSscreen.spec

This will automatically install the package after building it.  To build 
without installing, use "build-only" instead of "build".

All packages which contain libraries build both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of 
the library.  The 64-bit versions are installed in /opt/ts/lib/amd64.  If the 
package provides a 'foo-config' script, it will be installed in 
/opt/ts/bin/amd64.  If the package provides a pkgconfig pc, it will be 
installed in /opt/ts/lib/amd64/pkgconfig.  Set your $PATH and/or 
$PKG_CONFIG_PATH appropriately to use these 64-bit libraries.

Some packages include 64-bit binaries.  These will install the 64-bit binary in 
/opt/ts/bin/amd64.  In most cases, this binary will be automatically invoked on 
64-bit systems using isaexec; there is no need to set your $PATH manually.

(Substitute 'sparcv9' for 'amd64' on SPARC systems.)

Some packages include configuration files.  These are installed in 
/etc/opt/<package>/.  If a default configuration file is provided, it will have 
an extension of '.default' or similar.
