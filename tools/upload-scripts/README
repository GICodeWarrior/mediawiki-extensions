The master copy of these files is in /home/wikipedia/upload-scripts

'sync' is a script to copy the currently used files from this directory out 
to the image and thumbnail servers. 

'thumb-handler.php' is the primary 404 handler script point here; it parses
down the URL path to get the wiki, image name, and thumbnail size and options
and sends them to MediaWiki's thumb.php on the image scaler subcluster.
The generated file is then served out.

'404.php' is a copy of our general Wikimedia 404 script, which gets called from
thumb-handler.php if it doesn't appear to be a thumb.

'HTCPpurge' is a daemon to listen for HTCP proxy purge requests for thumbnails
and delete the corresponding files from the local filesystem. This was used
for the old thumbnailing server on 'anthony', but is no longer in use.
