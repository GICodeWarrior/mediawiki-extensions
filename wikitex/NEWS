          Skak  by  Torben  Hoffmann has replaced Piet Tute-
     laers' package as the <chess> renderer; Skak  is  back-
     wards compatible and allows, amongst other things:

          o    SAN and PGN notation

          o    large boards (with \largeboard)

          o    move arrows (with \printarrow)

     see the docs for details.

          <schem>  added;  id  est,  schematic  capture with
     gschem (geda.seul.org).  PPCH has been deprecated; XyM-
     TeX,  meanwhile, has taken its place as the <chem> ren-
     derer.

          Effort is underway to replace  our  ad-hoc  black-
     lists  with  chroot-based security; adieu, "directa non
     grata!"

          Lastly, verbose errors now declare  not  only  the
     whence, but the why of defects.

          We've disassociated our versioning from MediaWiki,
     and started with a pristine 1.0;  so  that,  should  we
     bundle  in  the  future, our release cycles can be dis-
     tinct.

          Changes almost too numerous to enumerate; but some
     of the more exciting:

     o    Gnuplot  and Graphviz: <plot> and <graph>, respec-
          tively

     o    Multi-page output for music, go and chess

     o    More detailed, helpful error messages

          The installation process, to boot, is less  error-
     prone;  no  Python:  but  the  bash  interface has been
     refactored.

          This candidate both maintains by  tightening  down
     our blacklist (thanks, Johannes Berg); and innovates by
     introducing Jan-Aoke Larsson's dvipng.  dvipng replaces
     dvi2bitmap; resulting in cleaner, faster renders.

          <math></math>  becomes  <amsmath></amsmath> in the
     stand-alone version, to avoid conflicting  with  texvc;
     in pre-packaged WikiTeX, it replaces texvc.

          I'd  also  like  to  un-cobweb that bash interface
     with Python before we go live.

          In order to plumb their  several  virtues'  depth,
     the  Batik  toolkit  ("heavy  SVG"),  will be available
     alongside ImageMagick; its more efficient kin.

          Batik  may  be  invoked  by  <batik></batik>;  and
     <svg></svg>, ImageMagick.

          SVG  is finally here; and we opted for Batik's SVG
     kit (xml.apache.org/batik) which, though very full-fea-
     tured,  suffers  from a Java-like retardation.  It were
     mere oeconomy that ever  importuned  us  to  return  to
     ImageMagick's SVG subset.

          With  the  introduction  of XML-like tags, we have
     cleared a major hurdle towards integration with  Media-
     Wiki; next on the list, parameters of the form:

          <music tempo="80"></music>

     WikiTeX'  vulnerability  to  attack  must also be thor-
     oughly sounded.

Sun May 30 00:00:00 PDT 2004  Peter Danenberg

          We're  refactoring WikiTeX from the ground  up  to
     implement tags of the form:





                        10 March 2005





                             -3-


          <class [parm: value]>content</class>

     and  likely  of  an  external  parser; where a lex/yacc
     solution might  be attractive.  (Finite state  recogni-
     tion  is  probably  what  we're looking  for,  however,
     rather  than  look-ahead  left-to-right  parsing;  i.e.
     top-down recursive descent.)

          If  WikiTeX'  sum scope, on the other hand, resem-
     bles  a  glue-script with regular-expression grinding,*
     we might not need  to  look  past  Perl;  PHP,  in  any
     case,  just passes as lexer/parser: but we'd like some-
     thing more robust and, above all, to separate  applica-
     tion from interface.
