	* wikitex.php (WikiTeX): \write, \let, \csname, \read,
	and \open added to the blacklist; thanks to Johannes
	Berg for the heads up.

	* wikitex.sh (strInc): removed some lingering hard paths;
	added support for dvipng; removed dvi2bitmap.

	* wikitex.inc.php (WikiTeX): 'math' class changed to 'ams'
	so as to avoid conflict with texvc; i.e. no chance of a
	de-coupling of texvc and MediaWiki anytime soon.

	* manifest.ms: updated

	* readme.ms: installation process for svg and batik

	* wikitex.php: added 'batik' and 'svg' elements; fixed
	invalid constructor in objRend which gave syntax errors
	in PHP4.

	* wikitex.sh: added 'batik' and 'svg' elements; changed
	error template to wikitex.error.inc.tex; and: transitioned
	to png from gif.

	* wikitex.svg.inc.svg: added

	* wikitex.batik.inc.svg: added

	* wikitex.inc.sh: inc.sh reintroduced; batik path in-
	erted; as well as indications for an Apache bandaid
	should defective paths prevail.

	* wikitex.php: added support for SVG; deciding currently
	on the Batikian solution (xml.apache.org/batik) since,
	while slow, it is very complete.  For oeconomy's sake,
	may switch later to ImageMagick's more limited, but faster,
	SVG subset.

	* wikitex.inc.php: transferred parms from LocalSettings.php
	hither; so as to produce a clean installation interface
	(merely the addition of line for the stand-alone distributees).

2004-09-06  Peter Danenberg  <danenberg at mitdasein dot com>

	* README: clarified acquisition

	* wikitex.php: added PHP4 constructor

	* wikitex.php: updated parse code to phase3 standards;
	WikiTeX now parses like pseudo-XML: <math></math>,
	<chem></chem>, etc.

	* wikitex.php: added new classes: go, xym, teng, and feyn.

2004-09-05  Peter Danenberg  <danenberg at mitdasein dot com>

	* README: added; with entry on extending WikiTeX.
