WikiTeX's security model has been reimplemented from the ground up:  We've doffed our dependence on blacklists, and instead rely on a combination of ulimit, quotas, sudo; and the native facilites of LaTeX and LilyPond for forbidding script execution and directory ascent.

In addition, the \(oqsrc\(cq and \(oqdata\(cq parameters allow you to reference uploads directly in your script; examples:

Skak by Torben Hoffmann has replaced Piet Tutelaers' package as the <chess> renderer; Skak is backwards compatible and allows, amongst other things:
.RS
.IP \(bu
SAN and PGN notation
.IP \(bu
large boards (with \\largeboard)
.IP \(bu
move arrows (with \\printarrow)

<schem> added; id est, schematic capture with gschem (geda.seul.org).  PPCH has been deprecated; XyMTeX, meanwhile, has taken its place as the <chem> renderer.

Effort is underway to replace our ad-hoc blacklists with chroot-based security; adieu, \(lqdirecta non grata!\(rq

Lastly, verbose errors now declare not only the whence, but the why of defects.

We've disassociated our versioning from MediaWiki, and started with a pristine 1.0; so that, should we bundle in the future, our release cycles can be distinct.

Changes almost too numerous to enumerate; but some of the more exciting:
.IP \(bu
Gnuplot and Graphviz: <plot> and <graph>, respectively
.IP \(bu
Multi-page output for music, go and chess
.IP \(bu
More detailed, helpful error messages

The installation process, to boot, is less error-prone; no Python: but the bash interface has been refactored.

This candidate both maintains by tightening down our blacklist (thanks, Johannes Berg); and innovates by introducing Jan-Aoke Larsson's dvipng.  dvipng replaces dvi2bitmap; resulting in cleaner, faster renders.
.PP
<math></math> becomes <amsmath></amsmath> in the stand-alone version, to avoid conflicting with texvc; in pre-packaged WikiTeX, it replaces texvc.
.PP
I'd also like to un-cobweb that bash interface with Python before we go live.

In order to plumb their several virtues' depth, the Batik toolkit ("heavy SVG"), will be available alongside ImageMagick; its more efficient kin.
.PP
Batik may be invoked by <batik></batik>; and <svg></svg>, ImageMagick.

SVG is finally here; and we opted for Batik's SVG kit (xml.apache.org/batik) which, though very full-featured, suffers from a Java-like retardation.  It were mere oeconomy that ever importuned us to return to ImageMagick's SVG subset.

With the introduction of XML-like tags, we have cleared a major hurdle towards integration with Media\%Wiki; next on the list, parameters of the form:
.QP
<music tempo="80"></music>

WikiTeX' vulnerability to attack must also be thoroughly sounded.

We're  refactoring WikiTeX from the ground up to implement tags of the form:
.QP 
<class [parm: value]>content</class>
.LP 
and likely of an external parser; where a lex/yacc  solution
might  be attractive.  (Finite state recognition is probably
what we're looking  for,  however,  rather  than  look-ahead
left-to-right parsing; i.e. top-down recursive descent.)

If  WikiTeX'  sum scope, on the other hand, resembles a

we might not need  to  look  past  Perl; PHP, in any case, just passes as
lexer/parser: but we'd like something more robust and, above
all, to separate application from interface.
