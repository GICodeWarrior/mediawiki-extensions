1.  Exigenda

     1.1.  Generic

     1.2.  Server

          Crontab
               Crontab to delete daily cruft (left over from
               over-ambitious  users who outstrip resources,
               causing files.

          Actions
               Plenary Classes

          Install
               Replace  ad-hoc  installations  by  copytree;
               fail on directory existence.

     1.3.  Client

     1.4.  Documentation

          Territory
               Copyright notices, etc.

          Permissions
               Work   with   MediaWiki   to  restrict  usage
               (optionally) to certain classes of users.

          XML-RPC-lib
               Add fallback-support for phpxmlrpc or Incutio
               for  those  with  little  control  over their
               installations, willing to take a  performance
               hit.

     1.5.  Handler

          Database
               Swap  out  home-brew  lock  system  for  some
               heavy-duty piece-of-shit (mysql,  say;  post-
               gre; or even sqlite3).

2.  Exacta

     Packaging
          Combine both server and client into a common pack-
          age, or utterly segregated (thus possibly not con-
          fusing the client-users)?

          Latter:  combined  source;  `src'  directory: con-
          tains: `client', `server'.

     PHP-client
          Basic request working; now to do something  useful
          with it.

     Temp-dir
          Does  cleanup happen after exceptions? (The object
          is deleted, after all.)

          Yes.

     Python Apache-handler
          Trader Joe acts as a  middle-man  between  locally
          running,  unprivileged,  chrooted  servers and the
          requesting public.

          More efficient? Possibly; will rebuke  the  prema-
          ture optimization for now.

     THANKS
          Get Erik in there. Hephaistos, Hermes Charmophron,
          Apollon, Hestia, Hera, Athena, dodeka Theoi.

     Footer/Header
          WikiTeX <VERSION> in footers  or  headers,  across
          from date

     Honest work in subserver
          Invocation of latex, dvipng

     Web install
          Installs into web-root and changes ownership.

     Title page
          ms-macro  to  institute  title  page (include with
          .so)

     License
          Includable ms-file for license (.so)

          2.1.1.  Cache

               Purview
                    Client-, server-side or both?

               Failure
                    Problem: in 1.0+, failed rendering don't
                    get cached and are rerendered every day.

                    Distinguish, therefore, between  server-
                    and  syntax-failures;  and cache accord-
                    ingly.

                    No: a simple flag  PHP  side  will  turn
                    on/off  error  caching; functioning sys-
                    tems can turn it  off  for  performance,
                    and for debugging purposes: back on.

                    It  may be useful to distinguish between
                    temporary and permanent errors, now that
                    we have ad-hoc classes.

     2.2.  Server

          Debug
               build_scripts command which takes --debug and
               disables optimization in wikitex-main.py

               No: rather a wikitex/main.py, and two trivial
               wrappers:  wikitex  and wikitex- debug, which
               are invoked with  `python  -O'  and  `python'
               respectively.

          IP-throttle
               Database of author vs. time

          setrlimit
               Per-request (post droppriv)

          MIME-types
               Currently  a  non-descript list in Constants;
               instantiate MIME-wrappers  with  well-defined
               instance variables.

          Delivery
               Client-server  contract  for  the delivery of
               content (keys for XMLRPC response); encode in
               a format parseable by PHP: XML, say?

               Right now: using an implicit contract (image:
               content).  A low-tech published API may  suf-
               fice.

     2.3.  Client

          Source
               `errors' directory to house the manifold.

          Authentication
               CURL-lib  on  PHP  can  handle basic and key-
               based.

          Errors
               Unified error presentation.

          Documentation
               Own  PHP-client  documentation,  or  combined
               with server's (current).

          2.3.1.  Cache

               Purview
                    Use  MediaWiki  mechanism with its over-
                    head, or some ad-hoc system?

               MediaWiki
                    MediaWiki mechanism: must be tweaked  to
                    forbid  arbitrary upload; but can detect
                    orphaned files: Special:Unusedimages.

                    Must forge, apparently,  a  subclass  of
                    WebRequest,  filling  in artificial val-
                    ues.

               Home-brew
                    Own mechanism: lightweight; but  respon-
                    sibility (cruft).

     2.4.  Documentation

          README Mon Jan 22 08:36:11 PST 2007
               Installation

          Build Sun Jan 21 01:46:55 PST 2007
               Build  target  in  Setup.py which invokes the
               Makefile in doc.

4.  Colophon

          This  document was prepared in GNU troff using the
     ms macro package; preprocessed with tbl, the table for-
     matter;  and  lastly  filtered  through  col  to remove
     reverse line feeds and tabs:

          groff -ms -t -Tascii SOURCE | col -bx > OUT

     Automatically generated contents were moved  from  page
     last to first with an ad-hoc bash-diddy.
