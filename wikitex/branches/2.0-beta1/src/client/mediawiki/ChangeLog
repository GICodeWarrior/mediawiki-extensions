	* WikitexRequest.php: Check the cache for interesting mime-types;
	errors are still cached regardless (when $DEBUG is true).  This
	doesn't seem to make sense for temporary errors such as `connection
	refused'.  TODO: Distinguish between cacheable and non-cacheable
	errors.
	Added username and password to curl-options.
	Curl should fail on, exempli gratia, bad username/password
	(CURLOPT_FAILONERROR).

	* Wikitex.php: Added latex function to abstract the details from
	LaTeX-dependant subrequests (say, amsmath).
