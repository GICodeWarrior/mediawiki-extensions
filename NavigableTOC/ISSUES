* Script assumes lines only break on spaces, but in practice lines can also be
  broken mid-word on - / & etc.  This means the presence of such breaks (e.g.
  in URLs) causes the script to scroll down a few lines too few or too many.
  Especially the latter is very confusing.
* Script assumes the letters in the textarea are 8x16 (Windows), 8x13 (Mac) or
  7x15 (Linux), but these values should really be determined dynamically.
* When previewing, two TOCs may show up (one in the preview, one navigable),
  in which case the first TOC gets two [hide] link and the second gets none
* When previewing a section, both the section content and the entire page are
  parsed, which is slow.
** We're parsing the entire page solely for its TOC, maybe we can take the
   old TOC from the parser cache and blend in the edited section?
** Is it even desirable to show full context here? Showing the edited section
   as top-level is less parser-intensive for section previews
* TOC is only shown when it'd normally appear on the page (4 sections or
  __TOC__ and no __NOTOC__), is this desirable?
