Semantic MediaWiki is a project for extending MediaWiki with "semantic"
functions that enable machine-reading of wiki-content. For details and
further links, see http://ontoworld.org/wiki/SMW

== Contributors ==

* Heiko Haller and Max Völkel contributed to the initial design and basic 
  architectural decisions.

* The German company Doccheck (doccheck.com) helped to get the implementation
  going at the early stages of the project, and set up the first testing wiki.
  The first implementation has been done by Klaus Lassleben.

* Further code has been contributed by (in no particular order) Kai Hüner, 
  Fernando Correia, Yaron Koren, and Nick Grandy.

== Translations ==

Translations to various languages are provided and maintained by many people.
In general, current maintainers should also be found in the language files.

* The Jurispedia project (www.jurispedia.org) has initiated and supported
  some of the translations:
** Translation to French has been contributed by Pierre Matringe.

** Translation to Spanish has been contributed by Javier Calzada Prado and
   Carmen Jorge García-Reyes of Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.

* Slovak translation has been provided by user helix84.

* Hebrew translation has been provided by Udi Oron.

== Credits to other projects ==

* Some icons used by Semantic MediaWiki are derived from the "Crystal Clear"
  icon theme for KDE, which was created by Everaldo (everaldo.com).

* The sorttable java script function was developed by Stuart Langridge,
  and taken from http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/sorttable. The current
  code for sorting tables is derived from this original code.

* The JavaScript upon which the Timeline format of inline queries is based is
  provided by Simile (http://simile.mit.edu). Note that it is distributed with 
  a BSD-style license, and not under the GPL that applies to most parts of 
  Semantic MediaWiki.

* Many people have contributed to the project by providing helpful comments and
  suggestions. Among them are the members of the Semantic Wiki Interest Group
  (swikig@aifb.uni-karlsruhe.de; see ontoworld.org), the people at the project
  mailing lists, and, of course, a number of anonymous reviewers. Thanks a lot!
