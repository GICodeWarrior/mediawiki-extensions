== About ==

Semantic MediaWiki is a project for extending MediaWiki with "semantic"
functions that enable machine-reading of wiki-content. For details and
further links, see http://ontoworld.org/wiki/SMW

Notes on installing Semantic MediaWiki are found in the file INSTALL.

== Credits ==

* After installation, a list of past and current developers is accessible
  via MediaWiki's Special:Version.

* The German company Doccheck (doccheck.com) helped to get the implementation
  going at the early stages of the project, and set up the first testing wiki.

* Some icons used by Semantic MediaWiki are derived from the "Crystal Clear"
  icon theme for KDE, which was created by Everaldo (everaldo.com).

* The sorttable java script function was developed by Stuart Langridge,
  and taken from http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/sorttable

* The JavaScript upon which the Timeline format of inline queries is based is
  provided by Simile (http://simile.mit.edu). Note that it is distributed with 
  a BSD-style license, and not under the GPL that applies to most parts of 
  Semantic MediaWiki.

* The Jurispedia project (www.jurispedia.org) has initiated and supported
  some of the translations:

** Translation to French has been contributed by Pierre Matringe.

** Translation to Spanish has been contributed by Javier Calzada Prado and
   Carmen Jorge García-Reyes of Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.

* Many people have contributed to the project by providing helpful comments and
  suggestions. Among them are the members of the Semantic Wiki Interest Group
  (swikig@aifb.uni-karlsruhe.de; see ontoworld.org), the people at the project
  mailing lists, and, of course, a number of anonymous reviewers. Thanks a lot!
