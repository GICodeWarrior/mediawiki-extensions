== Disclaimer ==

Semantic MediaWiki can be used for production wikis, but please note
that the software is still under development. In general, the extension 
can be installed into a working wiki without making any irreversible 
changes to the source code or database, so you can try out the software 
without much risk (though no dedicated uninstall mechanism is provided).
Every serious wiki should be subject to regular database backups. If you 
have any specific questions, please contact the authors.

For a proper legal disclaimer, see the LICENSE.

== Requirements ==

- MediaWiki 1.7.* or greater (tested up to 1.7.1)
- PHP 5.x or greater
- MySQL >= 4.0.14
- For the ontology import feature (only!), you need RAP, 
  a free RDF API for PHP, see
     http://www.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/suhl/bizer/rdfapi/

  You can copy/install additional components such as RAP
  into the "libs" directory of your Semantic MediaWiki
  installation.

== Installation ==

If you upgrade an existing installation of Semantic MediaWiki, also read the
remarks in the section "Notes on upgrading" below!

(1) Extract the archive or check out the current files from CVS to obtain the
    directory "SemanticMediaWiki" that contains all relevant files. Copy this
    directory to "[wikipath]/extensions/" (or extract/download it to this place).
    We abbreviate "[wikipath]/extensions/SemanticMediaWiki" as "[SMW_path]" below.
(2) Copy the file "[SMW_path]/includes/SMW_LocalSettingsTemplate.php" to a file
    "[SMW_path]/includes/SMW_LocalSettings.php". Edit this new file to adjust
    various basic settings. Some of these settings might be crucial for properly
    running the wiki, so be sure not to skip this step.
(3) Insert the following line at the end (just before "?>") of the file
    "[wikipath]/LocalSettings.php":
    "include_once('extensions/SemanticMediaWiki/includes/SMW_Settings.php');"
(4) In your wiki, log in as a user with admin status and go to the page
    "Special:SMWAdmin" to do the final setup steps.

This finishes the basic installation. There are some additional highly recommended 
features that need to be enabled individually if you want them. Read on.

'''Remark:'''  Semantic MediaWiki uses six additional custom namespaces (see
http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Custom_namespaces). If you have your own
custom namespaces, then you already specified this in step (2) above. If you
add more namespaces later on, then you have to assign them to higher numbers
than those used by Semantic MediaWiki in file "SMW_Settings.php".

=== Enabling support for templates, <nowiki>, ... ===

It can be helpful to have semantic annotations build into templates, in
particular if filler variables for them are provided dynamically on each
use. This feature can easily be enabled by hooking the processing of semantic
links to a later point during parsing. This is not done by default yet,
since it requires a patch against the MediaWiki code. To get this function,
do the following two steps:

(1) Edit the file [wikipath]/includes/Parser.php. Insert the line
    "wfRunHooks( 'InternalParseBeforeLinks', array( &$this, &$text, null ) );"
    in the method "internalParse" right after the line
    "$text = $this->replaceVariables( $text, $args );"
(2) Edit the file [SMW_path]/includes/SMW_LocalSettings.php to set the option
    $smwgEnableTemplateSupport to true.

Unless you changed the default setting, annotations in template articles will
be ignored automatically. Otherwise you have to use <noinclude> and <includeonly>
tags.

=== Enabling CSS, tooltips, etc. in MediaWiki < 1.7 ===

Deprecated. MediaWiki 1.6 is not officially supported any longer. You can try it 
without much risk, but we might use code and features that were not available in 1.6.

Extensions in MediaWiki < 1.7 could not add CSS or JavaScript to every
wiki page without some code changes to MediaWiki:

Open the file [wikipath]/includes/OutputPage.php, and insert the line
"smwfAddHTMLHeader($this);" between "wfProfileIn( 'Output-skin' );" and
"$sk->outputPage( $this );" (in function "output()").

If you have several installations running on the same MediaWiki installation,
and not all of them use the Semantic MediaWiki extensions, you may instead
choose to add the following three lines:
if( $_SERVER["HTTP_HOST"] == 'domainwith.smwenabled.org' ) {
       smwfAddHTMLHeader($this);
}

=== Enabling tooltips in MediaWiki <= 1.5.8 ===

Deprecated. MediaWiki 1.5 is not officially supported any longer. You can try it, 
but we probably use code and features that were not available in 1.5.

We make use of some JavaScript to display tooltips for attributes that provide
value conversions for different units. Up to MediaWiki 1.5.5, this is prevented
by bug http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3603. To fix this, edit
the file [wikipath]/skins/MonoBook.php and insert the line

 <?php $this->html('headscripts') ?>

right before "</head>" (around line 72). This should not be required in future
versions of MediaWiki. To check whether tooltips work, try the preview mode of
some article first (since this should always work). Tooltips might fail on some
other occassions -- check out the workaround in "Known issues".

If you prefer to use HTML-only tooltips, you can achieve this by commenting
out the line containing "ParserAfterTidy" within the file
[SMW_path]/includes/SMW_Settings.php.

== Notes on upgrading ==

The below instructions describe how to upgrade from one minor version to the next, e.g.
from 0.2 (or 0.2b) to 0.3. If you missed one of the updates (e.g. if you want to jump
from 0.1 to 0.3, then it is wise to proceed stepwise: install all intermediate versions
subsequently and follow the given update instructions. For example, first upgrade from 0.1
to 0.2 before upgrtading further from 0.2 to 0.3. Also, do not forget to backup your
database before any upgrade.

'''Upgrading from 0.5:'''

Please recreate your SMW_LocalSettings.php, since they have changed slightly.

'''Upgrading from 0.4.x:'''

Upgrading does not require any special changes. However, you have to upgrade MediaWiki to 1.7
and SMW to 0.5. This should not be a problem, and in fact you need one patch less. Please
recreate your SMW_LocalSettings.php, since it might have changed.

Moreover, the type "Geographic area" and "Geographic length" are no longer built in. But you 
can easily create them by yourself with the new type customisation features. See the docu at
ontoworld.org for details.

== FAQ ==

- Problem: I installed Semantic MediaWiki and all went fine. What should I do
  with it now?

  Semantic MediaWiki is there to help you to structure your data, so that you
  can browse and search it easier. Typically, you should add semantic markup
  to articles that cover a subject that is typical for your wiki. A single 
  article, semantic or not, will not improve your search capabilities. 

  Start with a kind of article that occurs often in your wiki, possibly with 
  some type of articles that is already collected in some category, such as
  cities, persons, or software projects. For these articles, introduce a small
  amount of relations and attributes, and annotate many of the articles in 
  this way. As with categories, less often is more in semantic annotation: do
  not use overly specific relations or attributes. A relation that is not 
  applicable in at least twenty articles is hardly useful.

  Templates can greatly simplify initial annotation. Create a flashy template
  for your users to play with, and hide the semantic annotations in the code
  of the template. Use the ParserFunctions extension to implement optional
  parameters, so that your users can leave fields in the template unspecified 
  without creating faulty annotations.

  Develop suitable inline queries (<ask> ... </ask>) along with any new 
  annotation. If you don't know how to use some annotation for searching, or 
  if you are not interested in searching for the annotated information anyway,
  then you should probably not take the effort in the first place. Annotate
  in a goal-directed way! Not all information can be extracted from the 
  annotations in your wiki. E.g. one can currently not search for articles that
  are *not* in a given category. Think about what you want to ask for before
  editing half of your wiki with new semantics ...

  If in doubt, choose simple annotations and learn to combine them into more
  complex information. For example, you do not need to have a category for
  "European cities" -- just combine "is located in::Europe" and "Category:City."
  In any case, if some annotation is not sufficient, you can still add more
  information. Cleaning too specific and possibly contradictory annotations
  can be more problematic.

- Problem: Previewing or storing articles with semantic relations causes
  database errors.

  Your database was not initialized properly. Go to Special:SMWAdmin for
  instructions.

- Problem: Semantic relations that are included via templates or excluded
  via <includeonly> statements are not processed properly.
- Problem: "&nbsp;" appears in the Factbox, comments and <nowiki> do not
  seem to disable annotations properly.

  Enable template support. The required manual patch is described above.

- Problem: After installing SMW, some or all pages are not displayed at all.
- Problem: In some cases, pages are displayed incompletely, with some parts
  vanishing.

  This is due to the restrictive memory default settings on some sites, and 
  is not directly caused by SMW (any additional extension code might cause this).
  Uncomment the line "ini_set( 'memory_limit', '20M' );" in LocalSettings.php
  and possibly adjust the value to your needs.

- Problem: I have a problem that is not in this list.
