== Disclaimer ==

For a proper legal disclaimer, see the file "COPYING".

In general, the extension can be installed into a working wiki without
making any irreversible changes to the source code or database, so you
can try out the software without much risk (though no dedicated uninstall
mechanism is provided). Every serious wiki should be subject to regular 
database backups! If you have any specific questions, please contact 
the authors.

== Requirements ==

* MediaWiki 1.11.* or greater (tested from 1.11.0 to 1.13alpha (r33087)).
* PHP 5.x or greater installed and working
* MySQL >= 4.0.14 (version required by MediaWiki)

Notes:
* SMW currently has experimental Postgres support. Testing and bug reports welcome.
* SMW uses the PHP mb_*() multibyte functions such as mb_strpos in the
php_mbstring.dll extension. This is standard but not enabled by default
on some distributions of PHP.
See http://php.net/manual/en/ref.mbstring.php#mbstring.installation
* SMW creates and alters temporary tables on the fly for certain semantic queries. 
  To do this, your wikidb user must have privileges for CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE, 
  DROP TEMPORARY TABLE, and ALTER TABLE. The according feature can be disabled by
  adding $smwgQSubcategoryDepth=0; and $smwgQPropertyDepth=0; to Localsettings.php.

== Installation ==

If you upgrade an existing installation of Semantic MediaWiki, also read the
remarks in the section "Notes on Upgrading" below!

(1) Extract the archive or check out the current files from SVN to obtain the
    directory "SemanticMediaWiki" that contains all relevant files. Copy this
    directory to "[wikipath]/extensions/" (or extract/download it to this place).
    We abbreviate "[wikipath]/extensions/SemanticMediaWiki" as "[SMW_path]" below.
(2) Insert the following two lines into the file "[wikipath]/LocalSettings.php":
       include_once('extensions/SemanticMediaWiki/includes/SMW_Settings.php');
       enableSemantics('example.org');
    where example.org should be replaced by your server's name (or IP address).
    If you have custom namespaces (e.g. "Portal"), read the note below.
(3) In your wiki, log in as a user with admin status and go to the page
    "Special:SMWAdmin" to do the final setup steps. This can also be done with
    a command-line php script. See [SMW_path]/maintenance/README for details.

'''Remark:'''  Semantic MediaWiki uses six additional custom namespaces (see
http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Custom_namespaces). If you have your own
custom namespaces, you have to set the parameter $smwgNamespaceIndex  before
including SMW_Settings.php. See the documentation within SMW_Settings.php for
details. If you add more namespaces later on, then you have to assign them to
higher numbers than those used by Semantic MediaWiki.

If you are using a Postgres database, install the needed database objects by 
importing the script "maintenance/SMW_Postgres_Schema.sql" using the psql 
utility like so:
  psql -U wikiuser -d wikidb -f maintenance/SMW_Postgres_Schema.sql
Replace with your username and database, and use a -h hostname or -p port 
as needed.


=== Testing your Installation ===

If you are uncertain that everything went well, you can do some testing steps to
check if SMW is set up properly.

Go to the Special:Version page and you should see Semantic MediaWiki (version nn)
listed as a Parser Hook and several wfSMWXxxx functions listed as Extension 
Functions.

Create a regular wiki page named "TestSMW", and in it enter the wiki text
  Property test:  [[testproperty::Dummypage]]

when you preview and save the page, the SMW "Factbox" should appear showing the
Testproperty as a link Dummypage.

If you don't get these results, check the steps in the Installation section, consult
the FAQ section, then contact the user support list (see the Contact section).

=== Customising Semantic MediaWiki ===

Semantic MediaWiki can be customised by a number of settings. To do so, you
can set respective parameters somewhere below the line
"include_once('extensions/SemanticMediaWiki/includes/SMW_Settings.php');"
in your LocalSetting.php. For example, one can write

 include_once('extensions/SemanticMediaWiki/includes/SMW_Settings.php');
 $smwgQDefaultLinking = 'all';
 enableSemantics('example.org');

to create links for all results returned by inline queries. The parameters that
are available are documented in the file SMW_Settings.php. Do not change this
file directly, but make all adoptions in your LocalSettings.php.

==== Semantic MediaWiki on small wikis -- extended features ====

Some features of SMW are turned off by default, since they could slow down larger
sites. If you run a small site or have a very controlled user base, then you may
wish to enable these additional features. Suggested entries for LocalSettings.php
are:

$smwgQEqualitySupport = SMW_EQ_FULL;  // always interpret redirects as equality in queries
$smwgQComparators = '<|>|!|~'; // enable the pattern search comparator ~ for strings

Further relaxation of default limits e.g. on query size are possible. See SMW_Settings.php.

==== Semantic MediaWiki on very large wikis -- improving performance ====

On very large or high traffic sites, further restriction of SMW features might be desirable
for performance reasons. Besides setting up the usual external caches and distributed 
DB-servers, you can also modify some SMW options to increase speed (while switching off
features). Try some or all of the below in LocalSettings.php:

$smwgQEnabled = false; // most radical -- no more semantic queries, just browsing/display features
$smwgQSubcategoryDepth = 0; // disable subcategory reasoning in queries
$smwgQSubpropertyDepth = 0; // disable subproperty reasoning in queries
$smwgQDisjunctionSupport = false; // completely disable disjunctions in queries
$smwgQMaxSize = 5; // allow only queries of 5 or fewer conditions (default 12)
$smwgQMaxDepth = 2; // allow only queries of depth 2 or smaller (default 4)
$smwgQMaxLimit = 100; // never ever return more than 100 results to a query (default 10000)
$smwgQDefaultLimit = 10; // only return 10 query results by default
$smwgRSSWithPages = false; // do not include pages into RSS feeds, speeds up feed generation
$smwgRSSEnabled = false; // switch off RSS feeds completely, so as not to atttract too many queries

These settings have different effects, and their effectiveness depends very much on the
usage and content structure of your wiki. You may wich to try out conservative settings
first and relax these step by step when things work reliably. If you have continued 
performance issues on your *large* wiki, please do not hesitate to contact the SMW developers 
for support.

=== Running SMW on older versions of MediaWiki ===

If your site is still running on PHP4, SMW is not supported. It would hardly be 
possible to backport the code to the old PHP version. If you have PHP5 but an 
older MediaWiki version, additional patches/modifications might be needed.
Download an older release of SMW and have a look at the included INSTALL
instructions to find out whether other changes are recommended therein.

== Notes on Upgrading ==

=== General Upgrading Instructions ===

All SMW data is extracted from wiki pages, and SMW offers an easy way of
recreating all internal data from the current wiki pages. Basically, this
could be done by executing Special:SMWAdmin as during the installation,
and by newly saving all wiki pages afterwards. Since the latter would be
rather cumbversome, SMW provides a maintenance script for refreshing all
data: SMW_refreshData.php reads all pages and recreates their semantic data.

Instructions:
(0) Read the rest of this section first.
(1) Install the new SMW version as described above.
(2) Install SMW_refreshData.php as described in [SMW_path]/maintenance/README
(3) Login to your server, and change directory to [wikipath]/maintenance
(4) Run "php SMW_refreshData.php -pv" and follow its progress.
(5) Run "php SMW_refreshData.php -v" and follow its progress.
(6) Run "touch [wikipath]/LocalSettings.php" to make sure that no cached old versions
    of wiki pages are used in the wiki.

Since the databse updates can take a long time, it might be better to perform them
via an SMW maintenance script as well instead of using Special:SMWAdmin. The according 
script is called SMW_setup.php. In case of problems, retry the above procedure with
the modified command "php SMW_refreshData.php -fpv" in step (4).

Some versions of SMW also introduced incompatibilities in the wiki syntax that
may need to be fixed. You may want to read this first.

=== Upgrading from 1.0 RC1, 1.0 RC2, 1.0 RC3 ===

Following the generic upgrading instructions above is recommended in any case. Moreover, some
configuration options have changed slightly between release candidates. Currently these are:

* $smwgQEqualitySupport now is no longer true/false, but one of SMW_EQ_NONE, SMW_EQ_SOME, SMW_EQ_FULL
* $smwgQDefaultNamespaces is now NULL by default, so that all namespaces are queried. The old default
  was "array(NS_MAIN, NS_IMAGE)".
* $smwgQDefaultLinking now defaults to 'all' such that all query results are linked. This is not a
  performance issue any more. The old default was 'subject'.

If you set any of these parameters in your LocalSettings.php, you need to update the config.
Please see SMW_Settings.php for more documentation on the available parameters.

=== Upgrading from version 0.7 ===

*The above generic steps are strictly necessary, and suffice to get a wiki that basically works.*

However, some further steps are strongly suggested. SMW1.0 mainly introduced the following 
incompatible changes to SMW0.7:

(a) The concepts (and namespaces) "Relation" and "Attribute" are now unified into "Property"
(b) The special property "Main display unit" is obsolete, and the property "display unit"
    shows slightly modified behaviour.
(c) The configuration options in LocalSettings.php have changed.

For (a), the namespace "Attribute:" was renamed into "Property:" -- you will find all your
former attribute pages in the new place. All SMW-generated property links now point to 
"Property", and thus work for your former Attributes. But the former Relations are still in 
their old namespace nd need to be moved. SMW provides the maintenance script
SMW_unifyProperties.php for this purpose.

Instructions:
(1) Install SMW_unifyProperties.php as described in [SMW_path]/maintenance/README
(2) Run "php SMW_unifyProperties" and follow its progress.

The script moves all Relation pages to the according Property page. Problems occur if you
had Attribute and Relation pages of the same title. It will report in which cases this
occurred and leave it to you to clean up the merged pages. You can also run the script
with option "-c" to get an overview of the conflicts, e.g. to delete undesired pages first.
The script can be run safely more than once.

In addition, you should run the MediaWiki maintenance script "refreshLinks.php" so that old
links in SMW Factboxes are refreshed to point to Property: instead of Relation:/Attribute:.

For (b), all (property) pages using properties "Main display unit" and "display unit" should
be updated: delete these annotations and use a single annotation "[[display units::...]]" 
instead. Its value is the list of units you like to have diplayed, separated by ",". See the
online docu for details. Running SMW_refreshData.php again (once) is required to reliably 
propagate the updated property setting to all pages.

For (c), please consult the file [SMW_path]/includes/SMW_Settings.php to find out about
the current options, and use only those in your LocalSettings.php (using older options
will not hurt, but has no effect). Note that some options have just changed labels, while
others were added or removed.

=== Upgrading from version 0.6 or 0.5 ===

It should in principle be possible to delete (move away) SMW, install a fresh SMW version,
and run all updates as in the case of SMW0.7. Patches to MediaWiki (known before SMW0.7) are
no longer required. Note that this upgrade has not been tested. An alternative would be to
upgrade to SMW0.7 first, and to move on to SMW1.0 next.

=== Upgrading from 0.4.x ===

Upgrading should work like for versions 0.6 and 0.5. The type "Geographic area" and 
"Geographic length" are no longer built in. But you can easily create them by yourself
with the new type customisation features. See the docu at ontoworld.org for details.


== FAQ ==

- Problem: I installed Semantic MediaWiki and all went fine. What should I do
  with it now?

  Semantic MediaWiki is there to help you to structure your data, so that you
  can browse and search it easier. Typically, you should first add semantic 
  markup to articles that cover a topic that is typical for your wiki. A single
  article, semantic or not, will not improve your search capabilities.

  Start with a kind of article that occurs often in your wiki, possibly with
  some type of articles that is already collected in some category, such as
  cities, persons, or software projects. For these articles, introduce a few
  properties, and annotate many of the articles with the property.
  As with categories, less is often more in semantic annotation: do
  not use overly specific properties. A property that is not applicable to at
  least ten articles is hardly useful.

  Templates can greatly simplify initial annotation. Create a flashy template
  for your users to play with, and hide the semantic annotations in the code
  of the template. Use the ParserFunctions extension to implement optional
  parameters, so that your users can leave fields in the template unspecified
  without creating faulty annotations.

  Develop suitable inline queries (<ask> ... </ask>) along with any new
  annotation. If you don't know how to use some annotation for searching, or
  if you are not interested in searching for the annotated information anyway,
  then you should probably not take the effort in the first place. Annotate
  in a goal-directed way! Not all information can be extracted from the
  annotations in your wiki. E.g. one can currently not search for articles that
  are *not* in a given category. Think about what you want to ask for before
  editing half of your wiki with new semantics ...

  If in doubt, choose simple annotations and learn to combine them into more
  complex information. For example, you do not need to have a category for
  "European cities" -- just combine "located in::Europe" and "Category:City."
  In any case, if some annotation is not sufficient, you can still add more
  information. Cleaning too specific and possibly contradictory annotations
  can be more problematic.

  Regularly review users' use of categories, properties, and types using 
  the Special pages for each.

- Problem: Previewing or storing articles with semantic properties causes
  database errors.

  Your database was not initialized properly. Go to Special:SMWAdmin for
  instructions. If all fails, run the maintenance script 
  "SMW_refreshData -vfp" (followed by "SMW_refreshData -v" if you already 
  stored annotations).

- Problem: In my non-English installation, properties don't work even when
  I follow the examples.

  Although SMW normally provides English aliases, you may need to use the 
  localised names for special properties and namespaces. The translated strings 
  and aliases for each language are in the languages subdirectory.

- Problem: After installing SMW, some or all pages are not displayed at all.
- Problem: In some cases, pages are displayed incompletely, with some parts
  vanishing.

  This is usually due to the restrictive memory default settings on some sites, 
  and is not directly caused by SMW (any additional extension code might cause this).
  Uncomment the line "ini_set( 'memory_limit', '20M' );" in LocalSettings.php
  and possibly adjust the value to your needs. More than 100M is harldy useful,
  but values around 50M might be required for large pages in some cases.

- When issuing semantic queries, I receive database errors that talk about some
  "illegal collation". Otherwise storing of annotations seems to work.

  Your database tables for MediaWiki and SMW have been generated with different
  settings. To fix the problem, first try to run the maintenance script 
  "SMW_refreshData -vfp" followed by "SMW_refreshData -v". If this does not help,
  you need to investigate the collation/character set settings of your DB.
  To do that, use a DB frontend tool or the SQL command "SHOW CREATE TABLE tablename;".
  Look up the collation/charset of, e.g., the table "categorylinks" and change the
  default collation/charset of your DB to these settings as described in the manual
  http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/charset-syntax.html
  Finally, run the aforementioned maintenance scripts again.

- Problem: I have a problem that is not in this list.

  Report general bugs at http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/ where you can also 
  find out whether your problem is known. You can also send an email to 
  semediawiki-user@lists.sourceforge.net (subscribe first at 
  http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_name=semediawiki-user)

  Provide the versions of PHP and MediaWiki and SMW that you are using, and
  any other extensions you installed (all this information is on the MediaWiki
  Special:Version page).

  Turn on debugging in MediaWiki (try 
  http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/How_to_debug_MediaWiki ) and you should see
  something in the log file.
