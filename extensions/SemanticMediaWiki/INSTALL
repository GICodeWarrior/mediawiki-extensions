== Disclaimer ==

Semantic MediaWiki can be used for production wikis, but please note
that the software is still under development. In general, the extension
can be installed into a working wiki without making any irreversible
changes to the source code or database, so you can try out the software
without much risk (though no dedicated uninstall mechanism is provided).
Every serious wiki should be subject to regular database backups. If you
have any specific questions, please contact the authors.

For a proper legal disclaimer, see the file "COPYING".

== Requirements ==

- MediaWiki 1.9.* or greater (tested up to 1.10alpha)
- PHP 5.x or greater installed and working
- MySQL >= 4.0.14
- For the ontology import feature (only!), you need RAP,
  a free RDF API for PHP, see
     http://www.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/suhl/bizer/rdfapi/

  You can copy/install additional components such as RAP
  into the "libs" directory of your Semantic MediaWiki
  installation.

== Installation ==

If you upgrade an existing installation of Semantic MediaWiki, also read the
remarks in the section "Notes on Upgrading" below!

(1) Extract the archive or check out the current files from SVN to obtain the
    directory "SemanticMediaWiki" that contains all relevant files. Copy this
    directory to "[wikipath]/extensions/" (or extract/download it to this place).
    We abbreviate "[wikipath]/extensions/SemanticMediaWiki" as "[SMW_path]" below.
(2) Edit the file [wikipath]/includes/Parser.php of your MediaWiki installation.
    Insert the line
     "wfRunHooks( 'InternalParseBeforeLinks', array( &$this, &$text, null ) );"
    in the method "internalParse" right after the line
     "$text = $this->replaceVariables( $text, $args );"
    This does not impair the wiki if SMW is not used, so it can be done even on
    wiki farms.
(3) Insert the following lines at the end (just before "?>") of the file
    "[wikipath]/LocalSettings.php":
     include_once('extensions/SemanticMediaWiki/includes/SMW_Settings.php');
     enableSemantics('example.org');
    where example.org should be replaced by your server's name (or IP address).
    If you have custom namespaces (e.g. "Portal"), read the note below.
(4) In your wiki, log in as a user with admin status and go to the page
    "Special:SMWAdmin" to do the final setup steps.

'''Remark:'''  Semantic MediaWiki uses six additional custom namespaces (see
http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Custom_namespaces). If you have your own
custom namespaces, you have to set the parameter $smwgNamespaceIndex  before
including SMW_Settings.php. See the documentation within SMW_Settings.php for
details. If you add more namespaces later on, then you have to assign them to
higher numbers than those used by Semantic MediaWiki.

=== Customising Semantic MediaWiki ===

Semantic MediaWiki can be customised by a number of settings. To do so, you
can assignemts to respective parameters directly after the line
"include_once('extensions/SemanticMediaWiki/includes/SMW_Settings.php');"
in your LocalSetting.php. For example, one can write

 include_once('extensions/SemanticMediaWiki/includes/SMW_Settings.php');
 $smwgIQDefaultLinking = 'all';
 enableSemantics('example.org');

to enable links on all results returned by inline queries. The parameters that
are available are documented in the files SMW_Settings.php (general) and
SMW_InlineQueries.php (related to queries).

=== Support for templates, <nowiki>, ... ===

The patch of [wikipath]/includes/Parser.php above was needed to make SMW work
with templates, <nowiki>, <!-- -->, etc. This change is not done by default yet,
since it requires a patch against the MediaWiki code.

Unless you changed the default setting, annotations in template articles will
be ignored automatically. Otherwise you have to use <noinclude> and <includeonly>
tags.

=== Running SMW on older versions of MediaWiki ===

If your site is still running on PHP4, SMW is not supported. It would be possible
to backport the code to the old PHP version, but this needs some work. If you have
PHP5 but an older MediaWiki version, additional patches/modifications might be
needed. Download an older release of SMW and have a look at the included INSTALL
instructions to find out whether other changes are recommended therein.

== Notes on Upgrading ==

The below instructions describe how to upgrade from one minor version to the next, e.g.
from 0.2 (or 0.2b) to 0.3. If you missed one of the updates (e.g. if you want to jump
from 0.1 to 0.3, then it is wise to proceed stepwise: install all intermediate versions
subsequently and follow the given update instructions. For example, first upgrade from 0.1
to 0.2 before upgrtading further from 0.2 to 0.3. Also, do not forget to backup your
database before any upgrade.

'''Upgrading from vesions prior to 0.6:'''

The file SMW_LocalSettings.php is now obsolete. Modify your LocalSettings.php as described
above, and import your changes in SMW_LocalSettings.php, if any, into LocalSettings.php as
well.

'''Upgrading from 0.4.x:'''

Upgrading does not require any special changes. However, you have to upgrade MediaWiki
and SMW. This should not be a problem, and in fact you need one patch less.

The type "Geographic area" and "Geographic length" are no longer built in. But you can
easily create them by yourself with the new type customisation features. See the docu at
ontoworld.org for details.


== Verifying your Installation ==

Go to the Special:Version page and you should see Semantic MediaWiki (version nn)
listed as a Parser Hook and several wfSMWXxxx functions listed as
Extension Functions.

Create a regular wiki page named "TestSMW", and in it enter the wiki text
  Relation test:  [[testrelation::Dummypage]]
  Attribute test: [[testattribute:=dummyvalue]]

when you preview and save the page, the SMW "fact box" should appear showing the
relation Testrelation to Dummypage and the attribute Testattribute with a warning
(since you haven't given it a type).

If you don't get these results, check the steps in the Installation section, consult
the FAQ section, then contact the developers (see the Contact section).


== FAQ ==

- Problem: I installed Semantic MediaWiki and all went fine. What should I do
	with it now?

  Semantic MediaWiki is there to help you to structure your data, so that you
  can browse and search it easier. Typically, you should add semantic markup
  to articles that cover a subject that is typical for your wiki. A single
  article, semantic or not, will not improve your search capabilities.

  Start with a kind of article that occurs often in your wiki, possibly with
  some type of articles that is already collected in some category, such as
  cities, persons, or software projects. For these articles, introduce a small
  amount of relations and attributes, and annotate many of the articles in
  this way. As with categories, less often is more in semantic annotation: do
  not use overly specific relations or attributes. A relation that is not
  applicable in at least twenty articles is hardly useful.

  Templates can greatly simplify initial annotation. Create a flashy template
  for your users to play with, and hide the semantic annotations in the code
  of the template. Use the ParserFunctions extension to implement optional
  parameters, so that your users can leave fields in the template unspecified
  without creating faulty annotations.

  Develop suitable inline queries (<ask> ... </ask>) along with any new
  annotation. If you don't know how to use some annotation for searching, or
  if you are not interested in searching for the annotated information anyway,
  then you should probably not take the effort in the first place. Annotate
  in a goal-directed way! Not all information can be extracted from the
  annotations in your wiki. E.g. one can currently not search for articles that
  are *not* in a given category. Think about what you want to ask for before
  editing half of your wiki with new semantics ...

  If in doubt, choose simple annotations and learn to combine them into more
  complex information. For example, you do not need to have a category for
  "European cities" -- just combine "is located in::Europe" and "Category:City."
  In any case, if some annotation is not sufficient, you can still add more
  information. Cleaning too specific and possibly contradictory annotations
  can be more problematic.

  Regularly review users' use of categories, relations, attributes, and types
  using the Special pages for each.


- Problem: Previewing or storing articles with semantic relations causes
	database errors.

  Your database was not initialized properly. Go to Special:SMWAdmin for
  instructions.

- Problem: Semantic annotations are not processed at all, but appear as
  links within the text.
- Problem: Semantic relations that are included via templates or excluded
  via <includeonly> statements are not processed properly.
- Problem: "&nbsp;" appears in the Factbox, comments and <nowiki> do not
  seem to disable annotations properly.

  Enable template support by the patch described in the installation above.
  Check that your page Special:Version shows SMW and lists the additional hook
  "InternalParseBeforeLinks".

- Problem: After installing SMW, some or all pages are not displayed at all.
- Problem: In some cases, pages are displayed incompletely, with some parts
  vanishing.

  This is due to the restrictive memory default settings on some sites, and
  is not directly caused by SMW (any additional extension code might cause this).
  Uncomment the line "ini_set( 'memory_limit', '20M' );" in LocalSettings.php
  and possibly adjust the value to your needs.

- Problem: I have a problem that is not in this list.
