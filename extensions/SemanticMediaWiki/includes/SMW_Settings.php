# SMW defers some tasks until after a page was edited by using the MediaWiki job
# queueing system (see http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Job_queue). For example,
# when the type of a property is changed, all affected pages will be scheduled for
# (later) update. If a wiki generates too many jobs in this way (Special:Statistics
# and "showJobs.php" can be used to check that), the following setting can be used
# to disable jobs. Note that this will cause some parts of the semantic data to get 
# out of date, so that manual modifications or the use of SMW_refreshData.php might
# be needed.

# Overwriting the following array, you can define for which namespaces

# the like. In fact, is is not obvious what a meaningful attribute of
# a talk page could be. Pages without annotations will also be ignored
# during full RDF export, unless they are referred to from another
# article.
