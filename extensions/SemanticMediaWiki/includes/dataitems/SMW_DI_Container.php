/**
 * Subclass of SMWSemanticData that can be made read only to enforce the
 * immutability of all SMW data items. This ensures that the container dataitem
 * can safely give out an object reference without concern that this is
 * exploited to indirectly change its content.
 *
 * Objects of this class are usually only made immutable when passed to a data
 * item, so they can be built as usual. When cloning the object, the clone
 * becomes mutable again. This is safe since all data is stored in arrays that
 * contain only immutable objects and values of basic types. Arrays are copied
 * (lazily) when cloning in PHP, so later changes in the cloce will not affect
 * the original.
 *
 * In contrast to normal SMWSemanticData objects, SMWContainerSemanticData can
 * be created without specifying a subject. In this case, the subject is some
 * "anonymous" object that is left unspecified (for search) or generated later
 * (for storage). The method hasAnonymousSubject() should be used to check for
 * this case (as the method getSubject() will always return a valid subject).
 * See the documentation of SMWDIContainer for further details.

/**
 * This class implements container data items that can store SMWSemanticData
 * objects. Containers are not dataitems in the proper sense: they do not
 * represent a single, opaque value that can be assigned to a property. Rather,
 * a container represents a collection of individual property-value assignments.
 * When a container is stored, these individual data assignments are stored --
 * the data managed by SMW never contains any "container", just individual
 * property assignments. Likewise, when a container is used in search, it is
 * interpreted as a patterns of possible property assignments, and this pattern
 * is searched for.
 *
 * The data encapsulated in a container data item is essentially an
 * SMWSemanticData object. The data represented by the container consists of
 * the data stored in this SMWSemanticData object. As a special case, it is
 * possible that the subject of this data is left unspecified. The name of the
 * subject in this case is not part of the data: when storing such containers, a
 * new name will be invented; when searching for such containers, only the
 * property-value pairs are considered relevant in the search. If the subject is
 * given (i.e. not anonymous), and the container DI is used as a property value
 * for a wikipage Foo, then the subject of the container must be a subobject of
 * Foo, for example Foo#section. In this case "Foo" is called the master page of
 * the container. To get a suitable subject for a given master page, the method
 * getSubjectPage() can be used.
