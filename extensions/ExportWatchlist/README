Export Watchlist Extension

The Export Watchlist extension provides two special pages which can be
used to dump one's watchlist to a plain text list of titles, and to bulk-add
pages to the watchlist from such a list.

This is convenient for keeping copies of watchlists, duplicating watchlists
across accounts, sharing watchlists with other users (and making them public)
and also for bulk-adding titles from a number of sources to the watchlist.

== Requirements ==

The Export Watchlist extension requires MediaWiki 1.8.0 or above.

== Installation ==

1. Place extension files into an "ExportWatchlist" directory in your
   MediaWiki "extensions/" directory
   
2. Add the line
   `require_once( "{$IP}/extensions/ExportWatchlist/ExportWatchlist.php" );`
   to LocalSettings.php.

Installation can be verified through the Special:Version page on the wiki.

== Usage ==

The extension introduces two new special pages:

* Special:ExportWatchlist
* Special:ImportWatchlist

=== Export ===

Logged-in users can export pages from their watchlist using the
Special:ExportWatchlist page, and can filter according to namespace.

Note: Discussion namespaces are not included in the exported list. This would be
redundant, as a watch is considered to exist for both a page and the associated
discussion page at the same time.

=== Import ===

Logged-in users can bulk-add/import pages to their watchlist using the
Special:ImportWatchlist page; when accessing the page, enter one or more titles,
one per line, in the text box provided, then click "Import". A list of watched
pages will be shown.
