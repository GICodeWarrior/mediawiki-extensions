This is an extension to MediaWiki to provide an OAI-PMH repository
interface by which page updates can be snarfed in a relatively sane fashion
to a mirror site.

OAI-PMH protocol specs:
http://www.openarchives.org/OAI/openarchivesprotocol.html

A harvester script will come soon to form the client half.


At the moment this script is quite experimental; it may not implement the
whole spec yet, and hooks for actually updating are not put in yet. ;)

The extension adds an 'updates' table which associates last-edit timestamps
with cur_id values. A separate table is used so it can also hold entries for
cur rows which have been deleted, allowing this to be explicitly mentioned
to a harvester even if it comes back after quite a while.

Clients will get only the latest current update; this does not include
complete old page entries by design, as basic mirrors generally don't need
to maintain that extra stuff.
