This is the AbuseFilter native expression parser.  It improves the performance 
of the filter by using a C++ program to parse the expression.

parser_native has been tested on these platforms:

* Solaris 10 (Intel Core 2) with GCC 3.4.3
* Solaris 10 (Intel Core 2) with Sun Studio 12 (C++ patch 124864-04)
* Debian Linux (Intel Xeon, AMD Opteron) with GCC 4.3.1
* Debian Linux (Intel Xeon) with Intel C++ 10.1.015

parser_native requires Boost (www.boost.org) 1.35.0 or higher.  Earlier versions
will generate a parser which does not work.

When compiled with GCC 4.3.1 (and perhaps later, but not earlier), Boost 1.35
will not work due to a bug in the date_time library.  Use GCC 4.2 or earlier
instead of this compiler.

parser_native also requires GNU MP (gmplib.org), with C++ support enabled
(--enable-cxx).

To compile it, copy makefile.config.example to makefile.config, edit it, and
run 'make'.  (GNU make is required.)

To run the test framework, run 'make test'.
