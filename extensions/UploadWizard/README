UploadWizard is dependent on js2 / mwEmbed, you must include JS2Support extension prior to UploadWizard.php

# To enable add the following to localSettings.php 

# JS2 / mwEmbed Support
require_once( "$IP/extensions/JS2Support/JS2Support.php" );

# Upload Wizard
require_once( "$IP/extensions/UploadWizard/UploadWizard.php" );
