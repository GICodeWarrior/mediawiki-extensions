You can't use browser back button
  Yes, this will be a bit of a challenge. So far it's a NTH not a must have.

Alert box "Please press this button to start your uploads." after pressing a button
  That's a mistake in the string

<thedj> if i'm on the first page, there are two buttons. "add another file" "upload" and "next". I'm slightly confused about what I should do. Press next, or press upload.
  We used to have it so that upload and next were the same button, that is, once it was finished, it went immediately to the next page.
  That felt weird. But perhaps we should hide [next] until all files are uploaded.

It exposes the local filename http://commons.prototype.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Jimmy_Wales_being_a_good_citizen.png
  I don't understand the criticism. The local filename is likely to be useful; if not we will filter for common patterns 
  of crappy autogenerated filenames.

Upload with "null" as summary http://commons.prototype.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:Upload_wizard_deadlock.png&action=edit
  Fixing this

Useless? "ZOMG THIS DEED IS NOT READY" message
  This is obviously a placeholder

You can reach to a deadlock situation http://commons.prototype.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Upload_wizard_deadlock.png

Wizard tabs show a link pointer but you can't browse there.

You are allowed to write new lines in the title (but should not)
Also, it doesn't trim leading/trailing whitespace

Font size in text fields is too small

Add support for upload from url
 
You can change the upload fields *after* they have been uploaded

No option to add another file after the upload (merge upload with next button?)
  Agreed

"To link to it in HTML, copy this HTML code:" fails for long urls (only the first line is shown, 
breaks at http://commons.prototype.wikimedia.org)
  Yup, agree here

UploadWizardPage.js contains wiki config. It should be a <script> tag int the page.
  I don't understand this comment -- NeilK

Noscript fallback doesn't work (no error either)

Noscript fallback should be a html equivalent Wizard
  Highly unlikely. noscript fallback will be a simple HTML4 file uploader.
