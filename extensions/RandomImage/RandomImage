== 1. Introduction ==

The Random Image extension adds a <randomimage> tag to the MediaWiki parser
which allows for randomisation of multimedia content on a page.

When the tag is rendered, a random image is selected from those uploaded and
inserted at the location of the tag. Users can select a custom size, float
and provide a caption for the resulting image.

At present, the output is cached in the parser cache alongside other parsed
content. This is advantageous in some cases, since it will prevent the database
from being crippled through repeated requests; however, it does mean that
the content is not 100% dynamic. The image will change when the parser cache is
expired, either automatically or by purging the page, allowing for rotation
of content.

== 2. Requirements ==

The Random Image extension has been tested against MediaWiki 1.7alpha and 1.6 and
should work with MediaWiki 1.5.

== 3. Installing the extension ==

To install the Random Image extension, first upload/copy the extension file 
RandomImage.php into your MediaWiki extensions directory. Then edit your
LocalSettings.php file and add the following line:

	require_once( 'extensions/RandomImage.php' );
	
Save the file (uploading if applicable) to complete the installation.

== 4. Inserting a random image ==

The tag supports two basic forms:
	
* Single, i.e. <randomimage />, which produces an image without a caption
* Container, i.e. <randomimage></randomimage>, where text inside the tags
  is used as a caption
  
In addition, both tags support two additional attributes; size and float.
The default size is the user's thumbnail size. Provide a numerical value
to override the size, e.g.

	<randomimage size="300" />
	
Float allows overriding the float direction. You can combine attributes as
with most normal HTML-style tags.
