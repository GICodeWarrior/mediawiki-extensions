== Overview ==

The Random Image extension adds a <randomimage> tag to the MediaWiki parser
which allows for randomisation of multimedia content on a page.

When the tag is rendered, a random image is selected from those uploaded and
inserted at the location of the tag. Users can select a custom size, float
and provide a caption for the resulting image.

== Requirements ==

This version of the RandomImage extension requires MediaWiki 1.10.0 or above.

== Installation ==

To install the extension, place all extension files into a `RandomImage`
directory within your MediaWiki `extensions` directory, then edit
`LocalSettings.php` and add the following line

	require_once( "{$IP}/extensions/RandomImage/RandomImage.php" );

Installation can be verified through the Special:Version page on the wiki.

== Use ==

The tag can be used in two forms:

	<randomimage />
		Produces an image without a caption
	<randomimage></randomimage>
		Produces an image with a caption (text inside the tags)
		
The tag also supports the following attributes:

	size
		Set the image width (default is the user's thumbnail width)
	float
		Float the image; valid values are 'left', 'center' and 'right'
	choices
		Confines image selection to a pipe-delimited list of images
		
For example:

	<randomimage size="100" float="left" choices="Apple.jpg|Pear.jpg" />

== Caching ==

By default, the output is cached in the regular parser cache. This can be
advantageous on larger sites which need to use caching to reduce the effects
of load, however, it means that content is not 100% dynamic.

To disable the parser cache on pages which use the <randomimage> tag, set
$wgRandomImageNoCache = true; in LocalSettings.php (after the call to include
the extension file). This will affect all users, and might incur additional
overhead on pageviews.
