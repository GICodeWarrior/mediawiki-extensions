This software is beta. There are missing features at this point.

This software is specifically designed for use by the Wikimedia Foundation.  
It is a workflow system designed for external users to apply for the use of
Wikimedia trademarks.


INSTALLATION:
============

1. Rename this directory to extensions/TradeTrack inside your
   MediaWiki directory.
2. Add database tables from TradeTrack.sql using the sql.php MediaWiki tool.
   (On Unix, if the current directory is the MediaWiki root directory, you can
   say "php maintenance/sql.php extensions/TradeTrack/TradeTrack.sql".)
   If you haven't created the AdminSettings.php file, you will have to do that
   first; see http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:AdminSettings.php
   Alternatively, you can run the SQL file manually (you can use the command
   "mysql -u $USER -p -e 'source TradeTrack.sql'" on Unix), but you might have to
   edit it first, and replace the /*$wgDBprefix*/ and /*$wgDBTableOptions*/
   strings with the corresponding settings.
3. Add this line to the end of your LocalSettings.php:
   require_once( "$IP/extensions/TradeTrack/TradeTrack.php" );
4. You need to define three email addresses in LocalSettings.php after that:

		$wgTradeTrackEmailCommercial = "foo@bar.com";
		$wgTradeTrackEmailNonCommercial = "foo@bar.com";
		$wgTradeTrackEmailMedia = "foo@bar.com";
