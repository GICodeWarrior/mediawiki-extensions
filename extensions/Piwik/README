MediaWiki Piwik Integration extension

version 0.8-piwik0.2.26 (1.0-RC3)
23 December 2008

This is the README file for the Piwik Integration extension for MediaWiki
software. The extension is only useful if you've got a MediaWiki
installation; it can only be installed by the administrator of the site.

== Minimum requirements ==

* MediaWiki 1.11+

* A Piwik installation with the site configured

== Installation instructions ==

Please, read them carefully. They're not very difficult to understand,
but ALL steps are necessary:

* Create a folder called "piwik" in your extensions directory

* Upload Piwik.php, Piwik.i18n.php, Piwik_specialpage.php and piwik-mw.js
  to the "piwik" folder you've just created

* Edit your LocalSettings.php and, at the end of the file, add the
  following:

        require_once($IP.'/extensions/piwik/Piwik.php');


* Then, you need to define where Piwik is installed and the "idsite".
  To do it, just add after the require_once:

        $wgPiwikURL = "http://piwik/url/";
        $wgPiwikIDSite = "piwik_idsite";

  Note: Change the value of $wgPiwikURL with the URL where you installed
        Piwik. Remember to add the trailing slash!

        Change the value of $wgPiwikIDSite with the number inside
        "piwik_idsite" in your Piwik code. For example, in:

            <!-- Piwik -->
            <a href="http://piwik.org" title="Web analytics" onclick="window.open(this.href);return(false);">
            <script language="javascript" src="http://piwik/url/piwik.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
            <script type="text/javascript">
            <!--
            piwik_action_name = '';
            piwik_idsite = 1;
            piwik_url = 'http://piwik/url/piwik.php';
            piwik_log(piwik_action_name, piwik_idsite, piwik_url);
            //-->
            </script><object>
            <noscript><p>Web analytics <img src="http://stats.astronomipedia.es/piwik.php" style="border:0" alt="piwik"/></p>
            </noscript></object></a>
            <!-- /Piwik -->

        the $wgPiwikIDSite is 1


* You can also set $wgPiwikCustomJS if you want to add custom javascript
  tags (see http://piwik.org/javascript-tag-documentation/ for further
  information). For example:

            $wgPiwikCustomJS = "piwik_hosts_alias = ["hostname1.com", "hostname2.com"]; // the current tracked website is added to this array anyway
            piwik_install_tracker = 0;"

* If you want to change piwik_action_name, you can set $wgPiwikActionName
  inside your LocalSettings.php file.

** In case you want to include the piwik_action_name as, for example,
   "wiki/Title of the page", you can set $wgPiwikUsePageTitle to
   true and set $wgPiwikActionName to "wiki/". The extension will print

			piwik_action_name = 'wiki/Title of the page';

* Since 0.8 (1.0-RC3), you can choose which users can see the special page
  setting the following in LocalSettings.php

			$wgGroupPermissions['usergroup']['viewpiwik'] = true;

  Where 'usergroup' is the name of the group. By default, only sysops can
  see the special page. If you want to allow bureaucrats to see the page,
  add that line with 'bureaucrat' where 'usergroup' is. The same is for
  normal users ('user') and anonymous users ('*').
