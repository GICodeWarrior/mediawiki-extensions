/**
 * fbconnect.js and fbconnect-min.js
 * 
 * FBConnect relies on several different libraries and frameworks for its
 * JavaScript code. Each framework has its own method to verify that the proper
 * code won't be called before it's ready. (Below, lambda represents a named or
 * anonymous function.)
 * 
 * MediaWiki:                addOnloadHook(lambda);
 *     This function manages an array of window.onLoad event handlers to be
 *     called be called by a MediaWiki script when the window is fully loaded.
 *     Because the DOM may be ready before the window (due to large images to
 *     be downloaded), a faster alternative is JQuery's document-ready function.
 * 
 * Facebook JavaScript SDK:  window.fbAsyncInit = lambda;
 *     This global variable is called when the JavaScript SDK is fully
 *     initialized asynchronously to the document's state. This might be long
 *     after the document is finished rendering the first time the script is
 *     downloaded. Subsequently, it may even be called before the DOM is ready.
 * 
 * jQuery:                   $(document).ready(lambda);
 *     Self-explanatory; to be called when the DOM is ready to be manipulated.
 *     Typically this should occur sooner than MediaWiki's addOnloadHook
 *     function is called.
