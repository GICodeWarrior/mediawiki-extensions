== Description ==
StalkerLog is designed to add a log of user login/logout actions
to the general log pages. Designed primarily for office productivity
monitoring, etc.

== Setup ==
* Download the extension from SVN
* Copy the files to a subdirectory of your extensions folder
* Add the following line to LocalSettings.php:
	require_once("extensions/StalkerLog/StalkerLog.php");

== Configuration ==
A new right of 'stalkerlog-view-log' has been created. Granting this
to a user via $wgGroupPermissions allows them to view the log. For
example, if managers in an office need to see the log but employees
shouldn't.
