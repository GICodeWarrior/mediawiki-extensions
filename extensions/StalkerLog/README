== Description ==
StalkerLog is designed to add a log of user login/logout actions
to the general log pages. Designed primarily for office productivity
monitoring, etc.

== Setup ==
* Download the extension from SVN
* Copy the files to a subdirectory of your extensions folder
* Add the following line to LocalSettings.php:
	require_once("extensions/StalkerLog/StalkerLog.php");

== Configuration ==
A new right of 'stalkerlog-view-log' has been created. Granting this
to a user via $wgGroupPermissions allows them to view the log. For
example, if managers in an office need to see the log but employees
shouldn't.

== Notes ==
The UserLogout hook was only modified to include the logging-out user
as of MediaWiki v1.13. As such, the logout hook won't work properly
on versions prior to that. The code fails gracefully and just doesn't
record user logouts. Should work on 1.11 and 1.12 with only this
problem. Before 1.11 isn't tested (and probably wont't work...)
