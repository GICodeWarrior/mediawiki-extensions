RELEASE NOTES of the MediaWiki extension RSS
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:RSS

=== TO DO ===
* bug 30377 add a new parameter to limit the number of characters when rendering
  the channel item <description>
* set an upper default limit for HttpRequest request size when fetching feeds
  doing a HEAD request first to ask for the size but that value may not be
  available. Check how much data is returned as its coming back
  in which case you'd override the content fetch callback and count data as it
  comes in or check the header, again, if it's provided, at the start of data
  coming in. Then you could abort cleanly once it's gotten too much
  (otherwise using the defaults - PHP will abort the entire program when your
  memory usage gets too high)
* bug 30028 "Error parsing XML for RSS" - improve and harden Extension:RSS when
  parsing differently flavoured RSS feeds

=== Version 1.90 2011-08-15 ===
* removed parsing of each single channel subelement (item)
* only the finally constructed feed is sent to the recursive parser:
  in pre-1.9 versions, each channel subelement (item) was sent to the parser
* [[MediaWiki:Rss-item]] default has channel subelement <description> added
* Rss template default name has been changed:

  until 1.8:  [[Template:RSSPost]]
        1.9:  [[MediaWiki:Rss-feed]], an existing [[Template:RSSPost]]
	      takes precedence to be compatible to pre-1.9 versions
* introducing [[MediaWiki:Rss-feed]] with a meaningful default.
  The channel subelements which make the feed are rendered in this
  new standard layout:
  * <title>
  : <description>
  : <author> <date>
* There are several ways to customize the final layout of feed items:
  1. Admins can change the [[MediaWiki:Rss-feed]] default page
  2. Users can use the optional template= parameter to tell the extension
     to render the feed with a different layout
     <rss template=Pagename>...</rss> use layout as in [[Template:Pagename]]
  3. <rss template=Namespace:Pagename>...</rss> use [[Namespace:Pagename]]

=== Version 1.8 2010-10-19 ===
* removed dependencies on Snoopy in favor of MediaWiki's internal HttpRequest
* removed MagpieRSS (perhaps to be replaced later with SimplePie)
  because of concerns about MagpieRSS's security problems and
  lack of maintenance.
* Added ability to do more with the layout of RSS feeds.

=== Version 1.7 2010-07-23 ===
* cleaned up, included MagpieRSS library
* put into the WMF subversion repository by Jeroen De Dauw
  http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:Jeroen_De_Dauw
* i18n file added by TranslateWiki.net people

**This appears not to be true; I have received numerous emails about it not working with 1.9+. I would love to help debug and fix the extension, but my host has not upgraded to PHP 5 and I'm thus stuck at MediaWiki 1.6.8, so that's as far as this is guaranteed to work properly. If anyone develops a fix, please post a link to it here! &#x2014;[[User:Alxndr|Alxndr]]&#x00a0;<sup>([[User talk:Alxndr|t]])</sup> 02:02, 16 June 2007 (UTC)
***I just found [http://nako.us/2007/03/16/mediawiki-19-fix-for-wfstrencode/ this fork] that purports to have a fix for the new loss of wfStrEncode(). I can't test it though so can anyone else verify that it works? &#x2014;[[User:Alxndr|Alxndr]]&#x00a0;<sup>([[User talk:Alxndr|t]])</sup> 02:18, 16 June 2007 (UTC)
