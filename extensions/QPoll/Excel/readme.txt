Uses the following PEAR classes:

PEAR-1.8.1.tgz
OLE-1.0.0RC1.tgz
Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer-0.9.1.tgz

Nested filename paths are replaced to longer filenames with underscores, because I find deep nesting unhandy.
require_once() and include_once() calls are also corrected relative from $qp_ExtDir extension global variable.

Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer-0.9.1 has a bug related to UTF16-LE string cell data encoding.
This bug can cause corruption of exported XLS files when non-ASCII set of codes
(such as Cyrillic or Chinesse) are used in polls.

The following path has been applied to 'Excel_Workbook.php' to fix this problem:
