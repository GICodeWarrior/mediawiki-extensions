== MediaWiki extension QPoll, version 0.8.0a ==

=== v0.7.0 ===

This extension allows to create polls embedded into the wikipages. Every poll
may contain a set of the questions of various types. The polls can be "chained"
(when the dependent poll would be available for voting only after a successful
submission of the "dependance" poll). Questions may have various types: with
unique, single or multiple category selections. Categories can be placed into
the groups (metacategories also known as category spans) to make a
"subquestions" inside a question. Optional dependence of the question's
proposal text on the user's choice of category in another previously voted
poll. Categories can be checkboxes, radiobuttons or text fields.

=== v0.8.0a ===
Now it is possible to:

* Create interpretation scripts for psychological tests and quizes
* Generate and store interpretations / marks / scores
* Highlight wrong answers to question proposals
* Log and limit number of answer attempts
* Select number of random questions for every user of the particular poll
  (similar to Russian EGE test)

which allows to use the extension as education tool.

Documentation will be updated when the extension will become stable enough.
