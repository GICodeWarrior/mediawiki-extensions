== Installation ==

Installation instructions are available online in a more convenient form for
reading at:

 http://semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Semantic_MediaWiki_Writer

Copy all files into MediaWiki's extensions folder, either by using SVN or by
extracting an installation package. You need to enter one line to your local
settings (somewhere after the inclusion of Semantic MediaWiki):

 require_once("$IP/extensions/SMWWriter/SMWWriter_Settings.php");
