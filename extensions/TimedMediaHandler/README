== TimedMediaHandler ==

* Broad support for input file formats
* Transcoder to make ogg video at web resolutions when embedding clips in a page
* include support for timed Text per the w3c "track" recommendation
* use embedPlayer mwEmbed javascript module for playback


This extension provides a media handler for the Ogg and WebM container format. When
enabled, a player will be automatically embedded in the image description page, 
or any wiki page using the same syntax as for images. 

To install this extension, add the following to the end of your LocalSettings.php:

	// You need mwEmbedSupport ( if not already added )
	require( "$IP/extensions/MwEmbedSupport/MwEmbedSupport.php" );
	
	// TimedMediaHandler
    require( "$IP/extensions/TimedMediaHandler/TimedMediaHandler.php" );

	// For boxes doing transcoding you should increase the allocated shell memory:
	$wgMaxShellMemory = 102400*64;
	
	
== Running Transcodes ==
To transcode the video you need to run webVideoTranscode jobs. In the trunk maintenance folder
you can run as the web user:
  php runJobs.php --type webVideoTranscode --maxjobs 1

If you want to have a job runner that checks for new jobs every 5 min in the maintenance folder 
of Timed Media Handler run: 
  WebVideoJobRunner.php


== Kaltura html5 player library ==
TimedMediaHandler uses the Kaltura html5 player library for video playback.

For more information about the player library visit: 
http://html5video.org or http://www.kaltura.org/project/HTML5_Video_Media_JavaScript_Library


== FFmpeg ==

We use FFmpeg for creating still images of videos, and for transcoding webm
videos. For best experience use the latest release of ffmpeg. At a minimum ffmpeg 0.6.1 was the
first version to include WebM support.  

You can download static ffmpeg builds for multiple platforms at:

 Some old versions of FFmpeg had a bug which made it extremely slow to seek in 
large theora videos in order to generate a thumbnail. This is fixed in the
current version. If you are using an old version of FFmpeg and find that
performance is extremely poor (tens of seconds) to generate thumbnails of 
theora videos that are several minutes or more in length, try applying our
ffmpeg-bugfix.diff.
  
Set the FFmpeg binary location with:

    $wgFFmpegLocation = '/path/to/ffmpeg';

after the require line in LocalSettings.php. 


== ffmpeg2theora ==

We use ffmpeg2theora for extract metadata from videos, you will need a copy on your 
server. For best experience use the latest release of ffmpeg2theora. At a minimum you need to use
ffmpeg2thoera 0.27 

You can download static ffmpeg2theora builds for multiple platforms at:
http://firefogg.org/nightly/ 

Set the ffmpeg2theora binary location with:

    $wgFFmpeg2theoraLocation = '/path/to/ffmpeg2theora';

Download ffmpeg2theora from: http://firefogg.org/nightly/

== PEAR File_Ogg ==

Tim Starling forked the PEAR File_Ogg package and improved it significantly in order to 
support this extension. Tim Starling  has now taken over maintainership of File_Ogg and 
merged my changes into the latest release. This extension will now work with 
either the bundled File_Ogg class, or a File_Ogg package from PEAR with 
version 0.3.0 or greater. It is licensed under the LGPL.

http://pear.php.net/package/File_Ogg

As per the usual convention, the PEAR base directory (the one with PEAR.php in 
it) must be in your include_path. Note you do not need to install PEAR, its included
with the TMH.
