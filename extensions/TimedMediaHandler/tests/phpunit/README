Some TimedMediaHandler testing notes: 
	
	We have a base class ApiTestCaseVideoUpload that establishes the uploads. Actual uploading
	is tested in the core uploading support so we focus these tests on timed media handler functionality 

 	We sometimes combine a few tests because fixtures don't play well with dataProvider 
 	since the mediawiki test framework nukes the db every time you run the next test in
 	a given dataProvider data set.
