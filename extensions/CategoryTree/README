The CategoryTree extension provides a dynamic view of the wiki's category
structure as a tree. It uses AJAX to load parts of the tree on demand.

<http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/CategoryTree_extension>

The CategoryTree extension was originally written by Daniel Kinzler in
2006 and is released under the GNU General Public Licence (GPL). The 
internationalization files contain contributions by several people;
they are mentioned in each file individually.


INSTALLING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Copy the CategoryTree directory into the extenstions folder of your 
MediaWiki installation. Then add the following lines to your
LocalSettings.php file (near the end):

  $wgUseAjax = true;
  require_once( 'extenstions/CategoryTree/CategoryTree.php' );
  
Note that $wgUseAjax = true; will enable the ajax framework in MediaWiki,
which is required by the CategoryTree extension. AJAX is a term for using
JavaScript to load parts of a page on demand. It is supported by all
recent graphic web browsers. For more information about AJAX see
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajax_%28programming%29>.


USAGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

CategoryTree can be used in two ways: as a "custom tag" to show a category
structure inline on a wiki page, and as a special page.

The special page is called Special:CategoryTree; there you can enter the
name of a category and then browse it's content. The CategoryTree
extension also adds a tab for this special page to every category page.

The custom tag is called <categorytree>. For example, if you put
<categorytree>Foo</categorytree> on a wiki page, it will show the contents
of category Foo as a dynamic tree on that page. The tag accepts three
attributes, using a HTML-like syntax:

* hideroot - set this to "on" to hide the "root" node of the tree, i.e.
             the mention of category Foo from the example.
             
* mode - can be "categories" (the default), "pages" or "all". "categories"
         only lists subcategories; "pages" lists all pages in the category
         except images; "all" shows all pages in the category.
         
* style - can be used to specify any CSS styles you would like for the
          tree.
          
          
OPTIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are some options you can spefify in your LocalSettings.php file:

$wgCategoryTreeMaxChildren - maximum number of children shown in a tree
                             node. Default is 200
                             
$wgCategoryTreeAllowTag - enable <categorytree> tag. Default is true.

$wgCategoryTreeDynamicTag - loads the first level of the tree in a 
                            <categorytag> dynamically. This way, the cache
                            does not need to be disabled. Default is false
                             
$wgCategoryTreeDisableCache - disabled the parser cache for pages with a
                              <categorytree> tag. Default is true.
