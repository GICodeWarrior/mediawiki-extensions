== About ==

Semantic Watchlist enables users to watch semantic properties by adding a new
watchlist page (Special:SemanticWatchlist) that lists changes to these properties.
Users can choose to follow one or more watchlist groups, which are administrator
defined, and cover a set of properties and a set of pages (category, namespace,
or SMW concept). Notification of changes to watched properties is also possible
via email. 

=== Feature overview ===

* A watchlist page (Special:SemanticWatchlist) listing changes to properties watched by the user.
* Per-user optional email notification per edit that changes properties.  
* Integration with user preferences to allow users to specify which watchlist
  groups they want to follow, and if they want to receive emails on changes. 
* Special:WatchListConditions as administration interface for watchlist groups.
* API module to query property changes grouped by edit for a single user.
* API modules to add, modify and delete the watchlist groups.
