The PageBy extension provides a custom tag, <pageby>, that renders as a 
summary of the pages edit history. 

<http://mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:PageBy>

The PageBy extension was originally written by Daniel Kinzler in 2007
and is released under the GNU General Public Licence (GPL).


The <pageby> tag shows up to three lines of information:

* page creation (not shown if creation="false" is given)
* contributor summary (lists all editors with the number of edits they made;
  not shown if there is only one eligible editor)
* last edit (not shown if  there is only one edit - unless page creation is 
  not being shown)


== Installing ==

Copy the PageBy directory into the extensions folder of your 
MediaWiki installation. Then add the following line to your
LocalSettings.php file (near the end):

  require_once( "$IP/extensions/PageBy/PageBy.php" );


== Usage ==

To get a short summary of the edit hostory:

    <pageby/>

You can provide options to controll the summary - for example, include minor
edits and hide edit comments:

    <pageby nominor="false" comments="false"/>

You can also specify another page than the one that contains the pageby tag:

    <pageby>Foo</pageby>

Note that using the pageby tag for *another* page will disable the parser cache
for the page the tag is used on. So perhaps don't do that on the main page.

For a full list of options, see below.


=== Options ===
The following options (tag attributes) can be used to controll the output of the
<pageby> tags:

* nominor       ignore minor edits ("true" or "false", default is "true"). 
                Applies only to to the contributors summary, does not effect
                creation or last-edit line.

* nobot         hide bots ("true" or "false", default is "true").
                Applies only to to the contributors summary, does not effect
                creation or last-edit line.

* noanon        hide anonymous users ("true" or "false", default is "false").
                Applies only to to the contributors summary, does not effect
                creation or last-edit line.

* comments      show edit comments ("true" or "false", default is "true").

* creation      mention page creation ("true" or "false", default is "true").

* time          show exact time in addition to the date ("true" or "false", 
                default is "false").

== Styling ==
The HTML generated by a <pageby> tag is a plain <ul>-list, but it assigns
different CSS classes to the individual elements, so you can style it
conveniently.

CSS classes used:

* pageby - used on the <ul>-tag that contains all output
* pageby-contribs - for the <li>-tag for the contribution summary
* pageby-last - for the <li>-tag for the latest edit
* pageby-contributor - for the <span>-tag of each contributor
* pageby-comment - for the <span>-tag containing the edit comment

An example CSS style to put into MediaWiki:common.css or a simmilar place:

  ul.pageby {
    float:right;
    clear:right;
    border:1px solid #60606F;
    background-color:#E0E0EF;
    font-size: 80%;
    margin:1ex;
    padding:1ex;
    list-style-type:none;
  }
