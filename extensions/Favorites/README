This extension provides the ability for users to create a list of 
favorites. It works separately from the Watchlist, and provides the 
ability to also embed your users' lists of favorites on a page (such as 
on the main page). 

== Database schema == 

A 'favoritelist' table is added to the wiki's database. This table 
contains the list of items that have been added to each user's favorite 
list. 

The table must be present for the wiki to function once the extension is 
enabled 

== Installation == 

To enable the extension, add the following line to your 
LocalSettings.php file: 

require_once("$IP/extensions/Favorites/Favorites.php"); 

You must then create and populate the new database table. 

The easiest way to do this is to run MediaWiki's standard updater: 
php maintenance/update.php 

If you do not have command-line access to your server, you can manually 
apply the favorites.sql file's commands to your database (check for 
proper table prefix, etc). 

== Configuration Parameters == 

If using the Vector skin, you may want to also add the "Star" icon to 
your navigation bar. To do this, add the following line '''above''' the 
"require_once" line in your LocalSettings.php file: 

$wgUseIconFavorite = true;
