== Overview ==

External Data is an extension to MediaWiki that allows for retrieving data
in CSV, JSON and XML formats from both external URLs and local wiki pages.

The extension defines three parser functions, #get_external_data,
#external_value and #for_external_table:

#get_external_data retrieves the data from a URL that holds XML, CSV or
JSON, and assigns it to local variables or arrays.

#external_value displays the value of any retrieved variable, or the
first value if it's an array.

#for_external_table applies processing onto multiple rows retrieved by
#get_external_data.

In addition, the extension defines a new special page, 'GetData', that
exports selected rows from a wiki page that holds CSV data, in a format that
is readable by #get_external_data.

== Requirements ==

This version of the External Data extension requires MediaWiki 1.8 or higher.

== Installation ==

To install the extension, place the entire 'ExternalData' directory
within your MediaWiki 'extensions' directory, then add the following
line to your 'LocalSettings.php' file:

     require_once( "$IP/extensions/ExternalData/ED_Settings.php" );

To cache the data from the URLs being accessed, you can call the contents
of ExternalData.sql in your database, then add the following to
LocalSettings.php:

     $edgCacheTable = 'ed_url_cache';

Finally, you can also set for string replacements to be done on the URLs you
call, for instance to hide API keys:

     $edgStringReplacements['MY_API_KEY'] = 'abcd1324';

== Contact ==
