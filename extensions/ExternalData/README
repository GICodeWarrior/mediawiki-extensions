== Overview ==

External Data is an extension to MediaWiki that allows for creating
variables from an external XML, CSV or JSON file. It defines two parser
functions, #get_external_data and #external_value:

#get_external_data retrieves the data from a URL that holds XML, CSV or
JSON, and assigns it to variables on the page.

#external_value displays the value of any such variable.

== Installation ==
