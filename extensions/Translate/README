== Installation ==
LocalSettings.php:

include("$IP/extensions/Translate/Translate.php");
$wgTranslateEC = array_keys($wgTranslateAC); // All modules
$wgTranslateFuzzyBotName = 'FuzzyBot';
$wgGroupPermissions['Translators']['translate'] = true;

Make sure you have configured $wgCacheDirectory properly.

* Users have to be a member of user group 'Translators' to enable full functionality.

If your extensions are located in a directory other than $IP/extensions/, you should
update $wgTranslateExtensionDirectory and $wgTranslateCssLocation. Check Translate.php
to see what values they expect.

=== Defining custom message groups ===

Example of creating message group for custom user interface of the wiki.
After including the extension, use the following code:

<code>
/* Value can be either anything callable, which is called by key as parameter,
 * or it can be instance of MessageGroup.
 */
$wgTranslateCC['wikigroup'] = 'customMessageGroups';

/* $id would be "wikigroup" */
function customMessageGroups( $id ) {
	$mg = new WikiMessageGroup( 'wiki-wikiname', 'wikiname-messages' );
	$mg->setLabel( 'Wikiname UI Messages' );
	$mg->setDescription( 'This group contains user interface messages used on Wikiname.' );
	return $mg;
}
</code>
