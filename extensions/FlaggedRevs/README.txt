http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:FlaggedRevs

== Setup ==
* Download the extension from SVN
* (MySQL) Run the 'FlaggedRevs.sql' query, substituting in your wiki's table prefix. 
* (PostgreSQL) Use 'FlaggedRevs.pg.sql' instead.
* Upgrade to MediaWiki 1.13+
* Run 'maintenance/update.php'
* Run 'maintenance/archives/populateSha1.php'.
* Make sure '../extensions/FlaggedRevs' is readable (for CSS/JS)
* To enable reader feedback, make sure PHP has the GD libraries installed. In windows, this is done by un-commenting them out in php.ini. 
In linux, php should be compiled with it enabled ('--with-gd'). See a nice guide here (http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/php/2003/03/27/php_gd.html).
* Add the following line to 'LocalSettings.php': 
	include_once('extensions/FlaggedRevs/FlaggedRevs.php');

It is important that the sha1 column is populated. This allows for image injection via key 
rather than the (name,timestamp) pair. In the future, image moves may be supported by MediaWiki, 
breaking the later method.

Be sure to set the $wgReviewCodes variable as well. See FlaggedRevs.php for details.

== Configuration ==
There is a commented list of configurable variables in FlaggedRevs.php. The online documentation
expains these further.

== Uninstallation ==
* Remove the include line from LocalSettings.php
* Drop the tables in FlaggedRevs.sql. Drop the columns 'page_ext_reviewed', 'page_ext_quality' and 'page_ext_stable', 
and the index 'ext_namespace_reviewed' from the page table.
* Run maintenance/refreshLinks.php from the command line to flush out the stable version links
