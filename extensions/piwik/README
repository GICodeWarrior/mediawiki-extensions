MediaWiki Piwik Integration extension

version 0.2 Alpha
25 May 2008

This is the README file for the Piwik Integration extension for MediaWiki
software. The extension is only useful if you've got a MediaWiki
installation; it can only be installed by the administrator of the site.

== Minimum requirements ==

* MediaWiki 1.11+

* A Piwik installation with the site configured

== Installation instructions ==

Please, read them carefully. They're not very difficult to understand,
but ALL steps are necessary:

* Create a folder called "piwik" in your extensions directory

* Upload Piwik.php to the "piwik" folder you've just created

* Edit your LocalSettings.php and, at the end of the file, add the
  following:

        require_once($IP.'/extensions/piwik/Piwik.php');
		

* Then, you need to define where are piwik.php and piwik.js files in your
  Piwik installation and the "idsite". To do it, just add after the
  require_once:
		
        $wgPiwikURLpiwikjs = "url/of/piwik.js";
        $wgPiwikURLpiwikphp = "piwik.php_location";
        $wgPiwikIDSite = "piwik_idsite";
		
  Note: Change the value of $wgPiwikURLpiwikjs with the URL inside
        "src". For example, in:
		
           <script language="javascript" src="http://domain/path/piwik.js"
           type="text/javascript"></script>
           <script type="text/javascript">
		  
        the $wgPiwikURLpiwikjs is http://domain/path/piwik.js


        Change the value of $wgPiwikURLpiwikphp with the URL inside
        "piwik_url" and the value of $wgPiwikIDSite with the number inside
        "piwik_idsite" in your Piwik code.
