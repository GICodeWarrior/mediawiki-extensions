==Maps change log==
This change log contains a list of completed to-do's (new features, bug fixes, refactoring) for every version of Maps.

===Maps 0.2===
(2009-07-29)

====New features====

* Backwards compatibility by using the $wgGoogleMapsKey when this one is set and $egGoogleMapsKey isn't.

* Hook for [[Extension:Admin_Links|Admin Links]]

* A true aliasing system for service names

* Centre parameter, that will allow you to set a custom map centre (different from the place where the marker will be put)

* Popups for the markers: title and label parameters to determine the pop-up contents

* Change the OpenLayers control handling. Make it accept all (36) OL controls by using eval() instead of a switch statement in the JS.

* 'physical' in the map type control of Google Maps maps when this map type is set

* Yahoo! geocoder (for parser functions)

====Refactoring====

* Refactor MapsBaseMap and all it's child classes. This will vastly increase code centralization and decrease redundant logic and definitions.

* Major rewrite of the Google Maps and Yahoo! Maps code. The parser function classes should only print a call to a JS function with all needed parameters, which then does all the logic and creates the map.

====Bug fixes====

* Issue causing aliases for service names getting turned into the default service since they are not in the allowed services list

* Remove redundant parts of the OL library

===Maps 0.1=== 
(2009-07-20)

* Initial release, featuring Google Maps (+ Google Earth), Yahoo! Maps and OpenLayers mapping services
