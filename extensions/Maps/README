== About ==

Maps is an extension that provides the ability to display coordinate data, using multiple
mapping services, including Google Maps, OpenLayers and Yahoo Maps, and allows users to
geocode addresses. It can be used together with Semantic Maps, which adds semantic
capabilities to the mapping services, but can also be used without it on non-semantic
wiki's. Both Maps and Semantic Maps are based on Semantic Google Maps and Semantic Layers,
and are meant to replace those extensions. Maps contains all functionality of Google
Geocoder, and so also replaces this extension.

Notes on installing Maps are found in the file INSTALL.
