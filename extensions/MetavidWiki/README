== About ==
Metavid Wiki is a project for extending MediaWiki with media
functions that enable community engagement with audio video metdata.
For more details visit metavid.ucsc.edu

== Disclaimer ==
Metavid Wiki is still under development. 
For more info come by #metavid or email dale@ucsc.edu 

==Short technical Description==
Metavid builds off of semantic mediaWiki but is not dependent on it. Its
just a matter of how structured you want your metadata ;) 

Metavid Wiki adds the following namespaces:
MV_NS_STREAM : Stream : The base namespace for media with temporal meta data.
    It manages stream file sets, and top level metadata for the stream. And
    provides an interface for editing temporal metadata associated with the stream.
MV_NS_MVD : The namespace for temporal metadata. Pages in this namespace
    follow the following format Stream_Name:mvd_type:time_start/time_end
MV_NS_SEQUENCE : The namespace for view/editing sequences/playlists.

The Search functionality is extended to do basic metadata queries and
return media results. (ie a category query can return all mvd chunks
in a given category range).

Categories are extended to include streams, video segments and sequences.
Categories are also extended to support rss video feed export.

Mv_Embed is a stand alone javascript library for playing back ogg theora
video in the browser. It extends oggHandler's plugin detect script and dynamically
calls javascript libraries which generalize plugin api's to something near
html5 video tag. Mv_embed also supports basic sequences via rss, xspf,
m3u or custom inline format and includes a basic in-browser sequence editor. 

==Install:==

==add to local settings.php ==
ParserFunctions are necessary
require_once( "$IP/extensions/ParserFunctions/ParserFunctions.php" );

//set up namespace:
$smwgNamespaceIndex=100;
//set metavid namespace to smw namespace + 6
$mvNamespaceIndex=$smwgNamespaceIndex + 6;
include_once("$IP/extensions/MetavidWiki/includes/MV_Settings.php");

//include SemanticMediaWiki settings (if used) 
include_once("$IP/extensions/SemanticMediaWiki/includes/SMW_Settings.php");
enableSemantics('localhost');

//include after enableSemantics to enable metavid Extension semantic wiki overrides
enableMetavid();


== base templates ==
These base Templates (for structuring output of metadata) can be added by running the
maintenance/metavid2mvWiki.php with the "update_templates" option.
(this also includes congress templates that may or may not be of use to you. 


==sql that must be run on install==
Have to update some tables: maintenance/updateTables.sql
 (will eventually be just one "update" script and integrated into the web based metavid admin)
