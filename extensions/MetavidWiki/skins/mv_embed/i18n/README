This _short_ document outlines the plan for internationalization support for stand alone
javascript libraries being integrated into mediaWiki.

A key piece is of this system is the script_loader.   

For static usage every script file should have an associative text js language file:
mv_embed.en.js 
mv_embed.es.js 
mv_embed.fn.js 

libSequencer_mv_sequencer.en.js
libSequencer_mv_sequencer.es.js

These static files will be updated via mediaWikis translation system.
 

These static files will be combined with the server side load script so that the language segment 
is requested at the same time the script is included. It won't result in a separate request because 
script_loader.php will combine the files. 

script_loader.php arguments: 
@uid 	_string the unique id to ensure fresh copy of the scripts
@sl  	_string the list of scripts with relative paths
@debug  _boolean if debug is "ON" don't send out minimised code 
the javascript should read this param on Document.URL and not group requests for ease of debuging. 


script_loader.php will take a set of scripts as arguments ie: 
http://server.com/script_loader.php?uid=SVN_Version_Number&sl=/mv_embed/mv_embed.js,mv_embed.en.js,/jQuery/jquery.js

It will minimise the scripts (strip comments and a custom stip of debug statements ie js_log('msg') 
can use:  http://code.google.com/p/jsmin-php/  for minimisation. 

Features: 
script_loader will concatenate all the minimised code from the requested set of scripts.

script_loader will send appropriate http cache headers. 
	Can expire _never_ since we send unique SVN version id to force updates. 
	This will integrate with the squid proxy setup so the minimisation just
	happens on fresh requests
	 
script_loader will read the client accept header and send out gziped or not. 

MediaWiki specific Features: 

We will want pass the il8n off to mediaWikis existing internationalization infastructure.  
MediaWiki should parse the il8n js file and check mediaWikis message space for any language variables.
Yes this does result in all js_variables being stored twice. 

But will have the advantage of being a stand alone solution for media remixing and should enable
wider participation in development.
