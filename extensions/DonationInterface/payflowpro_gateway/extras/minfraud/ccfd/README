API Documentation for CCFD service

$ccfs = new CreditCardFraudDetection;
  This creates a new CreditCardFraudDetection object

$ccfs->isSecure
  If isSecure is set to 0 then it uses regular HTTP.
  If isSecure is set to 1 then it uses Secure HTTPS (requires Curl PHP binding)

$ccfs->input($hash)
  Takes a hash and uses it as input for the server.
  See http://www.maxmind.com/app/ccv for details on input fields.

$ccfs->query();
  Queries the server with the fields passed to the input method
  and stores the output.

$hash = $ccfs->output();
  Returns the output from the server.
  See http://www.maxmind.com/app/ccv for details on output fields.

============
Secure HTTPS

If you want secure HTTPS then you need to have
the Curl PHP binding, the curl libary and the OpenSSL libary.

You can download the curl libary at
http://curl.haxx.se/download.html
http://curl.haxx.se/docs/install.html for installation details

If you do not have curl PHP binding then you should install it.
See the web page 
http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/php/install.html for details

It is recommended that you install these packages in this order
install the OpenSSL libary first
then install the Curl libary second
then install the Curl PHP binding last

Secure HTTPS is off by default.
If you have the Curl PHP binding, the Curl libary 
and the OpenSSL libary then you can turn on Secure HTTPS 
by setting:
$ccfs->isSecure = 1;
where $ccfs is the CreditCardFraudDetection object.
