 * The actual filters themselves are regular MW extensions and can optional be organized in filters/
 * They should be invoked by using the 'PayflowGatewayCustomFilter' hook, which will pass the entire
 * CustomFilter object to the filter.  The gateway object and its data are included in the CustomFilter
