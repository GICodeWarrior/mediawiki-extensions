== 1. Introduction ==

The new user email notification extension provides a clean and customisable
means to send email messages to one or more registered users upon the creation
of a user account. The behaviour of the extension can be controlled using
configuration options within the LocalSettings.php file for MediaWiki.

== 2. Installation requirements ==

This extension requires MediaWiki 1.8.0 or later.

== 3. Installing the extension ==

To install the extension, place all extension files into a NewUserNotif/
directory within your MediaWiki extensions/ directory, then edit
LocalSettings.php and add the following line

	require_once( "{$IP}/extensions/NewUserNotif/NewUserNotif.php" );

== 4. Editing the notification email ==

When preparing the email message to be sent to each recipient, the extension
relies upon two system messages. You will need to create these if you wish
to customise them, as detailed below:

MediaWiki:Newusernotifsubj
	This file contains the subject line for the email;
	$1 is replaced with the wiki site name from $wgSitename.

MediaWiki:Newusernotifbody
	This file contains the body text for the email.
	$1 is replaced with the username of the recipient;
	$2 is replaced with the username of the new user account;
	$3 is replaced with the wiki site name from $wgSitename;
	$4 is replaced with the time and date of the account's creation.

== 5. Further configuration ==

The behaviour of the extension can be tweaked using three configuration
variables. To override the defaults for these, set them in LocalSettings.php
underneath the call to the extension file.

$wgNewUserNotifSender
	Email address of the sender of the email
	Defaults to the value of $wgPasswordSender

$wgNewUserNotifTargets
	Array containing the usernames or identifiers of those who should receive
	a notification email. Email will not be sent unless the recipient's
	email address has been validated, where this is required in the site
	configuration.
	
	Defaults to the first user (usually the wiki's primary administrator)
	
$wgNewUserNotifEmailTargets
	Array containing email addresses to which a notification should also be sent
	Defaults to no additional addresses

== 6. Feedback ==
