Latest version of the install file: http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/trunk/extensions/PAMELA/INSTALL?view=co


== Installation ==

Once you have downloaded the code, place the ''PAMELA'' directory within your MediaWiki 'extensions' directory.
Then add the following code to your [[Manual:LocalSettings.php|LocalSettings.php]] file:

# PAMELA
require_once( "$IP/extensions/PAMELA/PAMELA.php" );

== Configuration ==

Configuration of PAMELA is done by adding simple PHP statements to your [[Manual:LocalSettings.php|LocalSettings.php]]
file. These statements need to be placed AFTER the inclusion of PAMELA. The options are listed below and their default
is set in the [http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/trunk/extensions/PAMELA/PAMELA.settings.php?view=markup PAMELA
settings file]. You should NOT modify the settings file, but can have a look at it to get an idea of how to use the 
settings, in case the below descriptions do not suffice.

There are no settings yet.
