== About ==

Data Transfer is an extension to MediaWiki that both exports XML based
on the current contents of pages in a wiki, and imports XML in the same
format, creating or modifying wiki pages based on the contents of the
XML file. The XML format for both exporting and importing uses template
calls, and the fields within them, to define XML tags. Any text that
is not within a template calls gets placed into one or more "free text"
tags.

For more information on Data Transfer, see the extension
homepage at

Notes on installing Data Transfer can be found in the file INSTALL.
