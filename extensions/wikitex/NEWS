     We're  refactoring WikiTeX from the ground up to imple-
ment tags of the form:
 
     <class [parm: value]>content</class>
 
and likely of an external parser; where a lex/yacc  solution
might  be attractive.  (Finite state recognition is probably
what we're looking  for,  however,  rather  than  look-ahead
right-to-left parsing; i.e. top-down recursive descent.)
 
     If  WikiTeX'  sum scope, on the other hand, resembles a
glue-script with regular-expression grinding,1 we might  not
need  to  look  past  Perl; PHP, in any case, just passes as
lexer/parser: but we'd like something more robust and, above
all, to separate application from interface.
