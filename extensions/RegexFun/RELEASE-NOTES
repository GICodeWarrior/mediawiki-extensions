 Changelog:
 ==========
 * November 4, 2011 -- Version 1.0 (initial public release).
   Introduces the following parser functions defined within 'ExtRegexFun' class:
   - #regex
   - #regexall
   - #regex_var
   - #regexquote
   
   Main features:
   - Searching within strings, using regular expression.
   - Replacing within strings, using regular expression.
   - Allows save use of user input within expressions by running '#regexquote' parser function
     over it. An important function other regex extensions still lack.
   - Allows to get the last '#regex' subexpression matches via '#regex_var', even allows to
     get them in an extensive way, e.g. "$0 has $2, $1 and $3".
   - Invalid regex will result in an inline error message instead of php notice as some other
     regex extensions might do it.
   - Efficient regex validation allowing all kinds of delimitiers and flags but filtering 'e'
     flag for security reasons in any case...
   - ... therefore, original 'e' flag instead has another but very similar meaning adjusted for
     a mediawiki context. Instead of executing php code within the replacement string, the 'e'
     flag now causes the replacement string to be parsed after references ('$1', '\1') are
     replaced. This allows stuff like "{{((}}Template{{!}}$1{{))}}" within the replacement.
   
   Changes since earlier versions (trunk and earlier, non-public):
   - '#regexsearch' parser function removed. Instead there is a special flag 'r' now which leads
     to the same result if #regex and replacement is being used: '' as output if nothing replaced.
   - '#regexascii' parser function removed. Instead '#regexquote' will make an ascii-quote MW
     special characters ';' and '#' if they are first character in the string.
   - '#regexquote' delimiter set to '/' by default.
   - '#regex' no longer returns its value as parsed wikitext (option 'noparse' => false) instead
     the 'e' flag can be used (although not exactly the same).
