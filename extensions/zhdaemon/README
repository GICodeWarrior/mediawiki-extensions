REQUIREMENT

- libconfuse, for configuration file processing
  http://www.nongnu.org/confuse/, or apt-get libconfuse-dev

- dictionaries
  The daemon needs to use several dictionaries. The code to build
  these dictionaries are currently in
  /phase3/includes/zhtable. Eventually zhtable should be moved to this
  directory, but for now please build them there first, and copy the
  following files to this directory:

      wordlist toCN.dict toTW.dict toHK.dict toSG.dict

  or alternatively, change the configuration file (see below) to point
  to them


CONFIGURATION

see zhdaemon.conf


PROTOCOL

Here is the current protocol: to do word segmentation, client should
send "SEG <length>\n" followed by data; to do conversion, client
should send "CONV <variant code> <length>\n" followed by data. On
success, the server responds with "OK <length>\n" followed by data, or
"ERROR <code>\n" if something goes wrong.
