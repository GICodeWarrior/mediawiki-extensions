== Introduction ==

This extension extends the RDF import and export functionality in Semantic MediaWiki
by providing import of arbitrary RDF triples (not only OWL ontologies, as before
(see http://semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Ontology_import), and a SPARQL endpoint
that allows write operations.

Technically, RDFIO implements the PHP/MySQL based triple store (and its accompanying
SPARQL Endpoint) provided by the [http://arc.semsol.org/ ARC2] library. For updating
wiki pages with new triples on import/sparql update, the SMWWriter extension is used.

The RDF import stores the original URI of all imported RDF entities (in a special
property), which can later be used by the SPARQL endpoint, instead of SMW's internal
URIs, which thus allows to expose the imported RDF data "in its original formats",
with its original URIs. This allows to use SMW as a collaborative RDF editor, in
workflows together with other semantic tools, from which it is then possible to
"export, collaboratively edit, and import again", to/from SMW.

This extensions was developed as part of a Google Summer of Code 2010 project. The
project description can be found at http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:SHL/GSoC2010

*Caution!* This extension is not yet ready for production use! Use it on your own risk!
