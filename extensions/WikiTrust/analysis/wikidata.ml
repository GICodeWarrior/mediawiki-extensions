(** Module wikidata.ml
    This module contains functions for reading the reduced statistics file. 
    The main function is read_data. 
 *)

(* Reduced statistics file format: 
   (It is documented here, so that it is versioned with the rest of the code) 

   General information: 

   Each page has an associated, unique, id, called the page id. 
   Similarly, each revision (more properly, it should be called version) has a unique integer id, 
   and the id is unique among all revisions of all pages. 
   Each user also has an integer id; if the id is 0, then the user is the "anonymous" user: 
   someone who is editing the Wikipedia without having first registered. 

   File format: 

   The reduced statistics file contains the following types of lines.  Here, "fixed string"
   means a string that is the same in all lines of the same type.  The description of each
   field is introduced by ;;. 


   Page: 1 Title: "Alessandro Manzoni"

        This line is at the beginning of a group of lines for a page, and contains some general 
        page data. 

        Page: ;; fixed string, identifying the type of the line. 
        1     ;; page id, an integer identifying the page
        Title: "Alessandro Manzoni" ;; an Ocaml-escaped string containing the page title. 

   TextInc 1030872359 PageId: 8179 rev0: 101832 uid0: 0 uname0: "Joe Black" rev1: 334539 uid1: 0 uname1: "God" text: 49 left: 47 n01: 3 t01: 16191768

	This line contains the information necessary to compute the increment of reputation of user 
	uid0 caused by uid1 still leaving, in its revision, some of the text that was introduced by 
	uid0. 

        TextInc ;; fixed string.
	1082314029 ;; Timestamp in seconds since UNIX epoch at which the judge revision (in this case 47128) was made.
	PageId: 1  ;; the page id is 1. 
	rev0: 29479 ;; the revision where the text was introduced has id 29479.
	uid0: 0 ;; the user who did revision 29479 is the user 0 (in this case, the anonymous user).
        uname0: "Joe Black" ;; the user name for uid0
	rev1: 47128 ;; the revision where we are measuring how much text is left is the revision 47128.
	uid1: 23 ;; the user who provides the comments is the user with id 23.
        uname1: "God" ;; the user name for uid1
	text: 846 ;; amount of original text: in revision 29479, 846 words were introduced. 
	left: 855 ;; amount of residual text: in revision 47128, 855 words are left of the contribution done in 29479. 
                     (evidently, in this case some words have been duplicated; duplicated words are still attributed to 
		     the original author). 
        n01: 3 ;; The number of revisions between rev0 and rev1, including rev1. In this case 3. So, the third revision
                  after rev0 was rev1.
        t01: 16191768 ;; The intervening time between rev0 and rev1. 

   TextLife 1073107958 PageId: 1 rev0: 29479 uid0: 0 uname0: "Joe Black" NJudges: 9 NewText: 846 Life: 7665

        This line summarizes the longevity of the text introduced at a particular revision. 

	TextLife ;; fixed string.
	1082314029 ;; Timestamp in seconds since UNIX epoch at which the revision was made.
	PageId: 1  ;; the page id is 1. 
	rev0: 29479 ;; The revision where the text was introduced is the 29479.
	uid0: 0 ;; The revision was done by user 0 (the anonymous one in this case).
        uname0: "Joe Black" ;; the user name for uid0
	NJudges: 9 ;; 9 other users then reviewed the page, and are judging the longevity of the edit done at revision 29479.
	NewText: 846 ;;  amount of original text: in revision 29479, 846 words were introduced.
	Life: 7665 ;; 7665 words of the text introduced at version 29479 appeared in the next 9 revisions.

	This line is used to compute an increment (positive or negative) to the reputation of the author of a revision, 
	according to how much the edits are still present at a later revision. 

	EditInc ;; fixed string.
	1113671446 ;; timestamp at which the edit was made.

	uid2: 231414 ;;

	d12: 613.17 ;; The distance between rev0 and rev2
        dp2: 302.00 ;; the distance between the revision before rev1, and rev2
        n01: 6 ;; The number of revisions between rev0 and rev1, including rev1.

   EditLife 1082322340 PageId: 1 rev0: 47136 uid0: 24 NJudges: 4 Delta:    3.52 AvgSpecQ: -0.06902

	This line gives the "edit longevity" of an edit. 

	"EditLife" ;; fixed string.
	1082322340 ;; timestamp at which the edit was made.
	PageId: 1 ;; the page id.
	rev0: 47136 ;; the revision where the edit was made.

        uname0: Tintin1107 ;; the name of user 24
	NJudges: 4 ;; the contribution of user 24 has been judged by 4 subsequent users.
	Delta: 3.52 ;; this is how much change user 24 has done (not much in this case).
	AvgSpecQ: -0.06902 ;; this is the "edit longevity" of the edit by user 24.  Here it is negative, denoting
		a contribution that did not go with the flow of the change in the page (but note that the 
		change in text is minimal).
