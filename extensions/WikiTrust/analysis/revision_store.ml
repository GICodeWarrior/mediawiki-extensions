(* The format of a blob is as follows: 

   header:binary_blob_content

   The header is guaranteed not to contain ":", so to find the start of the
   binary blob content, one can simply look for the ":". 

   The header is a list of (rev_id, rev_start, rev_len) items 
   (thus, in Ocaml, it has type (int * int * int) list)
   where: 
   - rev_id is the revision id
   - rev_start is the offset in the binary_blob_content
   - rev_len is the length, in bytes, in the binary_blob_content
