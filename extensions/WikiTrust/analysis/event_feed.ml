(* Event_feed works in one of three contexts:

   1. Local installation.
      Get the metadata _and_ text from the local database, 
      build a list of revisions, and return it.

   2. Remote installation. 
      The MW API has already pre-fetched the data.  We can
      thus query the local database, and proceed as above.

   3. WMF installation.
      The exec API is called, instead of the local db, to 
      figure out the list of revisions to process (the call
      to the exec API can happen in online_db). 
      Then, we read the revision text via the exec API, 
      and return the Online_revision.revision list. 

   So in summary, online_db must return an Online_revision.revision list
   with every revision already filled in with the text. 

   Online_page.ml should no longer read (uncolored) revision text.

   This allows us to batch together access to revision text, if needed.
