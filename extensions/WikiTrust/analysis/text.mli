(** [split_into_words disarm rearm sv] 
    splits a Vec of strings [sv] into an array of words.
    The [disarm] flag controls whether the &amp; &gt; and similar tags from the
    input are translated into & > and so forth.  The rearm flag controls whether
    the opposite transformation occurs once the parsing has occurred.
    Typically:
    To convert from dumps to blobs, use: true  false
    To convert from jason to blobs, use: false false
    To convert from dumps to xml for mwdumper use: true true
