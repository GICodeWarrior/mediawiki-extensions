(** This analysis measures how much "text display time" each author
    has contributed.  Precisely, for each author, it computes the total of
    the number of words inserted by the author, multiplied by the number
    of seconds for which the word was present in the Wiki. *)
(** We are not making the claim that this is the best way to measure
    author contribution.  For one thing, this measure under-estimates the
    work of people who revise and reformat revisions.  Nevertheless, this
    is a possible measure, and could be even more interesting if one then
    multiplied the "text display time" for each page, by the average
    number of daily page views.  See our WikiSym 2008 paper for a more
    thorough comparison of user contribution measures. *)
