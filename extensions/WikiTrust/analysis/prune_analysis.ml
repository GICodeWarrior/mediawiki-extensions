    writes only a certain number of latest revisions of a page.

    [out_file] is where to write the revisions, in xml format
    [keep_rev] is the max n. of revisions to keep 
    [keep_rev_after] is a date that specifies a time threshold for revisions to be kept
    [require_uid_change] indicates whether only the last revision, among consecutive 
      revisions from the same author, is to be kept.
    [equate_anons] indicates whether anonymous users have to be considered all equal,
