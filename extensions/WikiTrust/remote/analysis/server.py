This is a mod_python handler for wikitrust.

It listens for two types of requests: votes and colored_markup.

For votes, it registers the vote and returns the string "good"
For markup requests, it returns the markup if this is present.

Otherwise, it registers the need to color the revision and returns a text_not_found token.
