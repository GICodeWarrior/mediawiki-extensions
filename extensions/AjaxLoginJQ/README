This is the readme file for AjaxLogin extension.
The newest documentation for this extension can always be found at
<http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:AjaxLogin>.

==History==
AjaxLogin was written by Inez Korczy≈Ñski <korczynski(at)gmail(dot)com> for Wikia, Inc.

Some code hacks were written by Jack Phoenix <jack@countervandalism.net>.

Replaced YUI with JQuery - Chamindu Munasinghe <chamindu@calcey.com>.

==License==
GNU General Public License 2.0 or later

==Dependency==

JQuery

==Manual modifications==
You will need to modify one core MediaWiki file, includes/EditPage.php, if you want users to be able to log in with AjaxLogin
on edit view (?action=edit) without losing their changes.

Find protected function showFormBeforeText() and add this line inside the $wgOut->addHTML() call so that it'll be the first <input> to be added:

	<input type='hidden' value=\"\" name=\"wpLogin\" id=\"wpLogin\" />

==To-do & bugs==
This extension is right now a major hack. It requires YUI and isn't pretty in any case,
but it works and has been tested on MediaWiki 1.14alpha.

The JavaScript file should be rewritten so that the YUI dependency could be removed.
Obviously YAHOOTools.js should also be killed in the process.

Patches are more than welcome and they can be submitted either through Bugzilla <https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org> or emailed to me
<jack@countervandalism.net> directly.
