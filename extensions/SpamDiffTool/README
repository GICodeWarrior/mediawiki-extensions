Allows users to add entries to the Spam blacklist right off of a diff page

This extension allows users to add URLs to the Spam Blacklist (see the Spamblacklist Extension http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/SpamBlacklist_extension) easily without learning how to format entries for the blacklist and copy and paste, etc. By inserting a link on each diff page, if an editor sees that a given page has been the victim of spam, they can click on "add to spam", which extracts all of the URLs the spammer has placed on the page, going back over their most recent edits on the article (similar to Rollback). Then, for each URL detected, the tool prompts the user the degree to which they want to blacklist the URL. The options are block:

# all links from the domain
# all links from the specific subdomain
# all links from the subdirectory and subdomain
# nothing - don't add this to the blacklist

The idea is to try to streamline the process of cleaning up spam, rolling back spam edits and blocking users. When the spam addition process is finished, the user is taken back to the diff page they were on to begin with. From there, they can rollback the edits as required. 

As of November 9, 2006 this tool has been running for a few weeks on wikiHow, and made the lives of some admins much easier. Future versions might include the ability to block the user while adding the links to the spam blacklist, and rolling back the edits all at once.

== Pre-requisites ==

This software was tested with MediaWiki 1.6.7 and 1.8.2.


== Installation ==

To install, copy the file SpamDiffTool.php in the archive you downloaded to your extensions directory.

In your MediaWiki LocalSettings.php, add the following line some place towards the bottom of the file:

 require_once("$IP/extensions/SpamDiffTool.php");

Then, unfortunately, you have to hack 2 files to get the "add to spam" link placed on the appropriate diff pages. 

In DifferenceEngine.php, in showDiffPage, add after this section:

<pre>

                if ( $this->mNewRev->isCurrent() && $wgUser->isAllowed('rollback') ) {
                        $username = $this->mNewRev->getUserText();                        
                        $rollback = '&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>[' . $sk->makeKnownLinkObj( $this->mTitle, wfMsg( 'rollbacklink' ),
                                'action=rollback&from=' . urlencode( $username ) .
                                '&token=' . urlencode( $wgUser->editToken( array( $this->mTitle->getPrefixedText(), $username ) ) ) ) .
                                ']</strong>';
                } else {
                        $rollback = '';
                }
</pre>

The line:
<pre>
                $rollback .= '<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>' . wfSpamDiffLink($this->mTitle) . '</strong>';
</pre>

Then, there's another change so that new pages also get this feature, edit Article.php at line 930:

<pre>
            $wgOut->addHTML( 
                "<div class='patrollink'>" .
                    wfMsg ( 'markaspatrolledlink',
                    $sk->makeKnownLinkObj( $this->mTitle, wfMsg('markaspatrolledtext'), "action=markpatrolled&rcid=$rcid" )
                    ) .
+                . wfSpamDiffLink ($this->mTitle) .
                '</div>'
</pre>


wfSpamDiffLink will not be displayed for the users who aren't able to edit the Spam Blacklist. 


== Configuration ==

To specify which article you use as a Spam Blacklist, change the $wgSpamBlacklistArticle variable in SpamDiffTool.php.

== Bugs and enhancements ==

Bugs or feature requests can be sent to the author at travis @ wikihow.com. There is a good chance the regular expressions are not 100% perfect.
