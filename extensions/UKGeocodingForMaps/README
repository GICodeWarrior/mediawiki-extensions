The goal of this extension is to provide a way to display UK postcodes on Google Maps maps,
by extending the Maps extension. Since obtaining geocoded postcodes for UK Postcodes via Google
services is only possible using the Google AJAX search API, the standard geocoding infrastructure
of Maps could not be used, and this extension should be seen as a sort of hack. Initial
development for this extension was funded by Neill Mitchell for Prescient Software Ltd.

Version 0.2 is an experimental release, in which multiple issues are expected. I'm hoping to
polish the whole extension a little more once I have some free time. Bug reports are welcome though.
