You can get version 0.3 from SVN at

http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/trunk/extensions/UKGeocodingForMaps/

Once you have downloaded the code, place the 'UKGeocodingForMaps' directory within your MediaWiki
'extensions' directory. Then add the following code to your LocalSettings.php file:

# UK Geocoding For Maps
require_once( "$IP/extensions/UKGeocodingForMaps/UKGeocodingForMaps.php" );

The inclusion line needs to be placed AFTER the inclusion of Maps. Then get a Google AJAX search
API key if you don't already have one, and place it in your LocalSettings file after the inclusion
of this extension.

# Your Google AJAX search API key. Required for displaying Google Maps with the display_uk_point(s)
parser function.
$egGoogleAjaxSearchKey = 'your key here'; # http://code.google.com/apis/ajaxsearch/signup.html
