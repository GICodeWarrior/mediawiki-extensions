The GIS extension is based on the experience learned from WikiProject 
Geographical coordinates. The extensions can be enabled individually, but
the concept is certainly more powerful when they are all enabled.

Magnus Manske has been extremely helpful in the work on integration with 
Wikimaps, and that work will continue. I would also like to give a big thank
you to all participants in WikiProject Geographical coordinates who have
helped immensely with suggestions practical work.
