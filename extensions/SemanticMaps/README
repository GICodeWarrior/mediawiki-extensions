== About ==

Semantic Maps is an extension that adds semantic capabilities to the Maps extension,
and therefore provides the ability to add, view and edit coordinate data stored through
the Semantic MediaWiki extension, using multiple mapping services. These include Google
Maps, Open Layers and Yahoo Maps. Semantic Maps and Maps are based on Semantic Google
Maps and Semantic Layers, and are meant to replace these extensions. For this extension
to work, you need to have both Semantic MediaWiki and Maps installed.

Notes on installing Semantic Maps are found in the file INSTALL.
