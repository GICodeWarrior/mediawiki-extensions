== About ==

Semantic Maps is an extension that adds semantic capabilities to the Maps extension, and
therefore provides the ability to add, view and edit coordinate data stored through the
Semantic MediaWiki extension.

Due to it's unique structure, it allows you to use multiple mapping services to display
your coordinates. These include Google Maps, Yahoo! Maps, OpenLayers, and also allow you to
display maps with Google Earth, OpenStreetMaps, Bing maps and others. Modifying the mapping
service of a map is as easy as changing a single parameter! Examples of how to use Semantic
Maps can be found here.

Both Semantic Maps and Maps are based on Semantic Google Maps and Semantic Layers, and are
meant to replace these extensions.

Having Semantic MediaWiki and Maps installed is a prerequisite for the Semantic Maps extension;
the code will not work without it.

Notes on installing Semantic Maps are found in the file INSTALL.
