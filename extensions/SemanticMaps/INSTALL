[[Semantic Maps 0.5.5]]

Make sure you have Semantic MediaWiki, Maps and Validator successfully installed before proceeding
withthe installation. Semantic Maps and Maps are always released together. This means you should
always use the same version of Maps as the one of Semantic Maps you have. For example Maps 0.3.4
and Semantic Maps 0.3.4, but not Maps 0.2 and Semantic Maps 0.3. For the correct version of
Validator, see the INSTALL file of Maps. Once you have downloaded the code, place the 'SemanticMaps'
directory within your MediaWiki 'extensions' directory. Then add the following code to your
LocalSettings.php file after the lines that install Maps:

# Semantic Maps
require_once( "$IP/extensions/SemanticMaps/SemanticMaps.php" );

The placement of the inclusion of Maps and Semantic Maps needs to be at a certain position. Hold
the following rules into account:
* Maps needs to be included before Semantic Maps.
* Semantic MediaWiki needs to be included before Maps.
* Semantic Forms (if used) needs to be included before Maps (after SMW).
An example of a typical inclusion order: ..., SMW, ..., SF, ..., Validator, Maps, SM, ...

Once you have successfully installed Semantic Maps, please add your wiki to the sites that use
Semantic Maps section [0].
