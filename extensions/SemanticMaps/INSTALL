[[Semantic Maps 1.0.3]]

You can find a wiki version of this document, which includes various helpfull links, at
http://mapping.referata.com/wiki/Help:Installation#Semantic_Maps

Make sure you have Semantic MediaWiki, Maps and Validator successfully installed
before proceeding with the installation. Once you have downloaded the code,
place the 'SemanticMaps' directory within your MediaWiki 'extensions' directory.
Then add the following code to your LocalSettings.php file after the lines that install Maps:

require_once( "$IP/extensions/SemanticMaps/SemanticMaps.php" );

The placement of the inclusion of Maps and Semantic Maps needs to be at a certain position.
Hold the following rules into account:
* Maps needs to be included before Semantic Maps.
* Semantic MediaWiki needs to be included before Maps.
* Semantic Forms (if used) needs to be included before Maps (after SMW).

An example of a typical inclusion order: ..., SMW, ..., SF, ..., Maps, SM, ...

=== Installing 0.6 and above ===

This applies only to people installing version 0.6 or later.

Once You installed Semantic Maps, go to Special:SMWAdmin and run "database installation and upgrade".
If you do not do this, geographic coordinates will not work properly, and you might encounters
database errors on pages using them anyway.

=== Upgrading to 0.6 and above ===

This applies to everyone upgrading from the first Semantic Google Maps to Semantic Maps 0.5.5.

Make sure you have upgraded SMW to version 1.5.1 or above before installing Semantic Maps 0.6!

When upgrading to 0.6 from any previous version, you need to run the "database installation and upgrade"
script in Special:SMWAdmin. Not doing this will result into fatal PHP errors. You will also need to run
the "data repair and upgrade" script on the same page, which is required in order to store all
coordinates so that Semantic Maps recognizes them. Not doing this will result into queries not
returning any coordinates.

=== Upgrading from Semantic Google Maps ===

If you have Semantic Google Maps installed, and want to upgrade to Semantic Maps, these are the
steps you need to follow:

* Remove the SemanticGoogleMaps directory from your extension directory.
* Remove (when you use it) Google Geocoder in a similar fashion.
* Upload both Maps and Semantic Maps to your extension directory.
* Make sure your API keys are in the right place
  (the variable $wgGoogleMapsKey will need to be renamed, or copied, to $egGoogleMapsKey).
* Change all #semantic_google_map parser functions with #display_point.
* Add parameter names to the value of the #display_point calls.

After doing all these steps, you should be done. Maps and Semantic Maps are designed to be
backward compatible with SGM, so all SGM code ''should'' work on Semantic Maps. If you
encounter some problem though, please let the extension developers know.
