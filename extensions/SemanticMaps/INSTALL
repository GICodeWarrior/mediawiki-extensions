[[Semantic Maps 0.7.1]]

Make sure you have Semantic MediaWiki, Maps and Validator successfully installed before proceeding
withthe installation. Semantic Maps and Maps are always released together. This means you should
always use the same version of Maps as the one of Semantic Maps you have. For example Maps 0.3.4
and Semantic Maps 0.3.4, but not Maps 0.2 and Semantic Maps 0.3. For the correct version of
Validator, see the INSTALL file of Maps. Once you have downloaded the code, place the 'SemanticMaps'
directory within your MediaWiki 'extensions' directory. Then add the following code to your
LocalSettings.php file after the lines that install Maps:

# Semantic Maps
require_once( "$IP/extensions/SemanticMaps/SemanticMaps.php" );

The placement of the inclusion of Maps and Semantic Maps needs to be at a certain position. Hold
the following rules into account:
* Maps needs to be included before Semantic Maps.
* Semantic MediaWiki needs to be included before Maps.
* Semantic Forms (if used) needs to be included before Maps (after SMW).
An example of a typical inclusion order: ..., SMW, ..., SF, ..., Validator, Maps, SM, ...

Once you have successfully installed Semantic Maps, please add your wiki to the sites that use
Semantic Maps section [0].

=== Upgrading to 0.6 ===

Make sure you have upgraded SMW to version 1.5.1 before installing Semantic Maps 0.6!

When upgrading to 0.6 from any previous version, you need to run the "database installation and upgrade" script in [http://semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Installation#Upgrading_existing_installations Special:SMWAdmin]. Not doing this will result into fatal PHP errors. You will also need to run the "data repair and upgrade" script on the same page, which is required in order to store all coordinates so that Semantic Maps recognizes them. Not doing this will result into queries not returning any coordinates.

=== Upgrading from Semantic Google Maps ===

If you have Semantic Google Maps installed, and want to upgrade to Semantic Maps, these are the steps you need to follow:

* Remove the SemanticGoogleMaps directory from your extension directory.
* Remove (when you use it) Google Geocoder in a similar fashion.
* Upload both Maps and Semantic Maps to your extension directory.
* Make sure your API keys are in the right place (the variable $wgGoogleMapsKey will need to be renamed, or copied, to $egGoogleMapsKey).
* Change all #semantic_google_map parser functions with #display_point.
* Add parameter names to the value of the #display_point calls.

After doing all these steps, you should be done. Maps and Semantic Maps are designed to be backward compatible with SGM, so all SGM code ''should'' work on Semantic Maps. If you encounter some problem though, please let the extension developers know.
