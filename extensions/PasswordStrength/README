PasswordStrength README

1. INTRODUCTION
  This extension is designed to implement more stringent password 
  checks on registration/preference update.

2. INSTALLATION
  Place PasswordStrength.php in "$IP/extensions/PasswordStrength/". 
  Open LocalSettings.php and add the following line at the end:

require_once("$IP/extensions/PasswordStrength/PasswordStrength.php");

3. SETTING UP CHECKS
  $wgMustHaveInts - Setting this to any number of integers higher than 0 
     requires at least that many integers to be used.
  $wgMustHaveUpperCase - Same as above but with upper case characters.
  $wgMustHaveLowerCase - Same, lowercase

4. WARNINGS
  a) If anchors are not added to the regex (ie: ^\d+$), then all passwords 
  matching the regex _in part_ will fail (in the example, without anchors, 
  no numeric characters would be allowed).

5. TODO
  Password failure on login forces a password change
  Apply settings to registration

6. LICENSING
  PasswordStrength is made available under the conditions of the GNU General 
  Public License version 2 (or at your option, any later version). For more
