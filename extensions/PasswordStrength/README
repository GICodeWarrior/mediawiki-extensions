PASSWORDSTRENGTH README

1. INTRODUCTION
This extension is designed to implement more stringent password checks on registration/preference update.

2. INSTALLATION
Place PasswordStrength.php in "$IP/extensions/PasswordStrength/". Open LocalSettings.php and add the following line at the end:

require_once("$IP/extensions/PasswordStrength/PasswordStrength.php");

3. SETTING UP CHECKS
The global array $wgPSRegexChecks is a series of regular expressions to be applied to the password. The default (and example) is 
$wgPSRegexChecks[] = '/^\d+$/'; This would cause any password consisting of only numbers to be denied.

4. WARNINGS
a) If a user has a password that does not pass the check, then they are locked out of their account.
b) If anchors are not added to the regex (ie: ^...$), then all passwords matching the regex _in part_ will fail (in the example, without
anchors, no numeric characters would be allowed).

5. TODO
Make it where a password failure on login (due to invalid complexity) forces a password change, not an account lockout (this requires
a modification to core).

6. LICENSING
