====Bug fixes====

* Fixed bug causing error for people who do not have Semantic Forms installed and enabled, presumably introduced in 0.3.

* Fixed bug causing only the last coordinate property from a result to be shown on a map format, and so causing the predecessors to be ignored in case of multiple coordinate properties.

====Refactoring====

* Restructured the extension to work with the new feature hook system of Maps.

===Semantic Maps 0.3.3===
(2009-08-15)

====New functionality====

* Yahoo! Maps and OpenLayers now handle the "icon=" parameter that can come from Semantic Compound Queries, as Google Maps already did.

====Bug fixes====

* Mapping formats get added only once, as opossed to multiple times in version 0.2.2.
