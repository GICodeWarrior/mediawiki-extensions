This extension provides a media handler for the Ogg container format. When
enabled, a player will be automatically embedded in the image description page, 
or any wiki page using the same syntax as for images. 

To install this extension, add the following to the end of your LocalSettings.php:

    require( "$IP/extensions/OggHandler/OggHandler.php" );

FFmpeg
------

We use FFmpeg for creating still images of videos, you will need a copy on your 
server. Unfortunately the current version of FFmpeg has a bug which makes it
extremely slow when used in this way. Our ffmpeg-bugfix.diff will fix this. 

Download source: http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/download.html
About the bug: http://bugzilla.mplayerhq.hu/show_bug.cgi?id=892

Set the FFmpeg binary location with:

    $wgFFmpegLocation = '/path/to/ffmpeg';

after the require line above. 

Cortado
-------

The bundled Cortado player is licensed under the GPL, the source is available from:

    http://www.flumotion.net/cortado/

We have patched Cortado to allow multiple instances to exist on the one page, 
the patch is in cortado-tweak.diff. The recompiled binary is at 
cortado-ovt-stripped-0.2.2.1-patched.jar .

PEAR File_Ogg
-------------

The PEAR directory contains a fork of the File_Ogg package, licensed under the
LGPL. The stock File_Ogg will not work -- I have made many aggressive changes
including support for stream formats other than Vorbis. I'll try to get my
changes committed to the official PEAR tree at some point in the future.

Graphics
--------

The icons play.png, pause.png, stop.png and info.png are from the Crystal Project:
