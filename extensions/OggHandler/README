This extension provides a media handler for the Ogg container format. When
enabled, a player will be automatically embedded in the image description page, 
or any wiki page using the same syntax as for images. 

To install this extension, add the following to the end of your LocalSettings.php:

    require( "$IP/extensions/OggHandler/OggHandler.php" );

FFmpeg
------

We use FFmpeg for creating still images of videos, you will need a copy on your 
server. Unfortunately the current version of FFmpeg has a bug which makes it
extremely slow when used in this way. Our ffmpeg-bugfix.diff will fix this. 

Download source: http://ffmpeg.mplayerhq.hu/download.html
About the bug: https://roundup.mplayerhq.hu/roundup/ffmpeg/issue159

Suggested configure line for minimal functionality:

./configure --disable-demuxers --disable-muxers --disable-decoders --disable-encoders \
  --disable-ffserver --disable-ffplay --enable-encoder=mjpeg --enable-muxer=mjpeg \
  --enable-decoder=theora --enable-demuxer=ogg --disable-network \
  --build-suffix=-still

Set the FFmpeg binary location with:

    $wgFFmpegLocation = '/path/to/ffmpeg';

after the require line in LocalSettings.php. 

Cortado
-------

The cortado directory contains a fork of the Cortado Java applet by Fluendo. For
information about the original project see:

    http://www.flumotion.net/cortado/

See LICENSE.cortado, LICENSE.jheora and LICENSE.smoke for license information. 

Our fork contains several bug fixes and feature additions. Fluendo appears to 
have stopped maintaining Cortado. We recommend you file bug reports in
Wikimedia's bug tracker.

PEAR File_Ogg
-------------

I forked the PEAR File_Ogg package and improved it significantly in order to 
support this extension. I have now taken over maintainership of File_Ogg and 
merged my changes into the latest release. This extension will now work with 
either the bundled File_Ogg class, or a File_Ogg package from PEAR with 
version 0.3.0 or greater. It is licensed under the LGPL.
