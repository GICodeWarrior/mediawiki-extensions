DATE FORMATTER EXTENSION
Version 1.0

== Introduction ==

This extension adds a parser hook to MediaWiki which will refactor
free dates according to the user's preference. This works on unlinked
dates, as opposed to the built-in refactoring module, and utilises
a separate class.

== Requirements ==

This extension requires:

* PHP 5.0.x (5.1.x *strongly recommended*) or above
* MediaWiki 1.7.0 or above

== Installation ==

To install the extension, please download or check out all files from
the Subversion repository, and place them in a "FormatDates" directory
within your MediaWiki extensions directory.

You then need to edit your LocalSettings.php file, and add the following
line, somewhere near the bottom:

	require_once( "{$IP}/extensions/FormatDates/FormatDates.php" );
	
Access the Special:Version page on your wiki to confirm the installation.

== Usage ==

To make use of the extension, when editing a page, include <date></date>
tags containing free dates into the text. For instance:

	On <date>January 1, 2007</date>, which is the same day of the
	year as <date>1 January 2006</date> was, at least, in respect of
	being <date>January 1</date>...
	
When the page is rendered, these dates will be detected and refactored
according to the date preference of the viewing user. If no preference
is specified ("no preference"), no refactoring will take place.
