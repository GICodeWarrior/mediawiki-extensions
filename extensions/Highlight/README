This extension allows source code to be syntax highlighted on the wiki pages.

== Installation ==
* Download the latest stable build from http://geshi.org/, and unzip it into extensions/Highlight/ directory.
  (Note: the zip file creates a sub-directory called geshi/, and places a file geshi.php there)

* Add this line to your LocalSettings.php:  
    require_once("extensions/Highlight/SyntaxHighlight.php");


== Usage ==
On the wiki page, you can now use "source" elements:

<source lang="php">
<?php
    v = "string";    // sample initialization
?>
html text
<?
    echo v;         // end of php code
?>
</source>
