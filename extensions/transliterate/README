This is an interface to the ICU text transformation/transliteration service.

For some reason some PHP installations need a CXX environment variable to
configure properly:

CXX=g++ ./configure

Not sure if that's my fault or not.

Typical usage:

   $latin = transliterate_with_id('Any-Latin', $foreign);

Observed timing for is ~30ms on first call and ~3ms thereafter, plus ~1.5us per
character.
