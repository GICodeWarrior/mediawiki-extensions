5) The Upload seems to take more time than I expect, but that could be a function of generating the six thumbnails.
6) There's no 404 handler to generate missing thumbnails.
7) There's no support for remote thumbnailing.
8) Test cases (but of course that could be done until the cows come home).
9) Read through the code and look for anything which is insane.
10) Remove directory from $wgLocalFileRepo, to make sure that there's no references to it. Ditto for wgDeletedDirectory and deletedDir.
11) Determine what to do about the one remaining core change needed for Swift.
12) Implement repo->freeTemp() - needed by several extensions and UploadFromStash.
13) Do we need $wgLocalRepo->ThumbUrl to be configurable given that the Python middleware presumes it?
