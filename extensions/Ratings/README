== About ==

The Ratings extension provides a tag extension that when embedded in a page allows users to
rate different "properties" of the page.

The main reason for creating a new extension is that Rating Bar has been replaced by "W4G Rating Bar",
which is not open source, so does not allow for adding any improvements.

== Alpha version ==

Do note this extension is still in alpha stage. Although core functionality is mostly working,
some things still need to be implemented, and many things are in need of some polishing. A
particular thing lacking decent support now is handling of the rating control when the
user is not allowed to rate.

Some feature that might be added in the feature is displaying lists of votes and lists of
pages based on votes. Integration with SMW is also possible. And vote summaries can be
cached better.
