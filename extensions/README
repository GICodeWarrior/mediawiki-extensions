The "extensions" module regroup code can be used to enhance your MediaWiki
experience. Some of the extensions are large and we did not want to keep
them in the main MediaWiki branch. For example wikihero is a great tool to
easily get Egyptian hieroglyphs but it contains hundreds of pictures.

A minimal description of extension functionality is usually available
inside $wgExtensionCredits in the setup file of an extension. More
elaborate documentation may be available on http://www.mediawiki.org. See
'url' inside $wgExtensionCredits for the exact URL to the documentation.
