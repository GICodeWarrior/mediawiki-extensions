== Overview ==

Page Schemas is an extension to MediaWiki that allows for defining all the
schema information about a "class", or data type - for naming, display,
data input, and browsing - within a single piece of XML contained within a
category page. This XML can then be used to generate all the necessary
additional pages needed to put the schema into effect, such as template
pages and, for instance, if Semantic Forms is installed, form pages. The
XML can be created and edited via a helper form, preventing users from
having to generate or modify it manually.

Page Schemas allows other extensions to define their own fields to add to
the XML, using hooks.

For more information, see the extension homepage at:
