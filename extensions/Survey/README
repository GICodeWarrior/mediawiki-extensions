== About ==

Survey is a MediaWiki extension that allows administrators to define surveys
that can then be shown to specified groups of users.

=== Feature overview ===

* Surveys get displayed to wiki users using a nice pop-up form.
* Surveys can be created and modified via an admin panel (Special:Surveys).
* Surveys can be shown to specific types of users (logged in, anonymouse, editor, confirmed, ...)
* Surveys can be shown for a specified percentage of users, and only after a certain amount of page views.
* Survey questions can have different types of inputs, of which some allow restricting answers.
* Surveys can be tested by admins via Special:TakeSurvey without them being live on the wiki.
* Summaries of survey submissions can be found on Special:SurveyStats.
* The survey submission data (ie user answers) can be exported via an API.
