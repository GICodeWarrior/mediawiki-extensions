== Overview ==

Semantic Compound Queries is an extension to MediaWiki that defines a
parser function, '#compound_query', that displays the results of the
equivalent of multiple Semantic MediaWiki #ask queries at the same time.
The syntax of #compound_query resembles that of #ask, but with more than
one query, and with the elements of each sub-query delimited by semicolons
instead of pipes. Elements that are common across all sub-queries, like
'format=' and 'width=' (for maps) should be placed after all sub-queries.

A sample call to #compound query, which retrieves both biographies, along
with their subject; and fiction books, along with their author; is:

{{#compound_query:[[Category:Books]][[Has gentre::Biography]];?Covers subject=Subject
	|[[Category:Books]][[Has genre::Fiction]];?Has author=Author
	|format=list}}
