  What is this?
  -------------

  Exhibit is a DHTML-based AJAXy faceted browser.



  Running Exhibit
  ----------------

  Exhibit consists of a bunch of static resources. All you really need is to
  serve those resources off a web server. Any web server would do.
  
  But if you don't have any available to you, we have configured the timeline
  project to be runnable Jetty, so if you have a java virtual machine 
  installed you can open a shell or command prompt and type:
  
   [win32]> run
   [unix/macosx]> ./run

  and then point your browser to
  
   http://127.0.0.1:9999/timeline/
  


  How do I customize Exhibit?
  ---------------------------

  Refer to the Exhibit web site at
