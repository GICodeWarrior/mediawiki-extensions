== Overview ==
SRF-Ploticus is a query printer for Semantic MediaWiki that uses
Ploticus to create plots, charts and graphics out of query results.

== Installation ==
The following should be installed and running.

1) Semantic MediaWiki
2) Ploticus 2.40 (http://ploticus.sourceforge.net).  
   Patch required if you plan to use SVG/SVGZ formats with imagemaps. (see Imagemap section below)

When both of them are up and running, you can install this extension like
any other semantic result printer (refer to the separate README for that).

LocalSettings.php Modifications:
-------------------------------
 * $srfgPloticusPath (REQUIRED)
   - path to ploticus executable. Typically /usr/bin/ploticus (Debian/Ubuntu) or /usr/bin/pl (RedHat/CentOS, most other envs)
 
 * $srfgEnvSettings (default: '')
   - Ploticus behavior can be further modified by setting environment variables.  You can pass this env vars using this setting.
     E.g. if you plan to use alternate TrueType fonts in your plot.
       GDFONTPATH=/usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont:/usr/share/fonts/truetype/msttcorefonts
       
     E.g. if you plan to use additional fonts in SWF files
       SWF_FONTS_DIR=/usr/share/ming/fonts/ttf-dejavu/fdb
       
     E.g. set global ploticus config parameters with a config file.  See ./ploticus-addons/ploticus.config for a sample config file and
     http://ploticus.sourceforge.net/doc/config.html for more info.
       PLOTICUS_CONFIG=/etc/ploticus/ploticus.config
     
    Remember, you can pass multiple environment variables, e.g.
      GDFONTPATH=/usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont PLOTICUS_CONFIG=/etc/ploticus/ploticus.config
   
 * $srfgPloticusCacheAgeHours (default: 168 - 7 days)
   - number of hours cached plot files are stored in the ploticus cache before they are forcibly purged.
   Set to 0 if you prefer to purge the cache manually.
   This is required, especially with liveupdating plots, since changing query results will "orphan" plot cache files as the computed hash filename
   will change even if the query definition itself is NOT changed.

   This setting will only work if the SRF_Ploticus_cleanCache.php script is scheduled on cron.  Typically, it should only be run once a day.   
   For example, run cleanCache at midnight, logging results to /var/log/ploticus_cleanCache.log:

   0 0 * * * /usr/bin/php /var/www/wiki/extension/SemanticResultFormats/Ploticus/SRF_Ploticus_cleanCache.php -v 2>&1 > /var/log/ploticus_cleanCache.log
  
   If you're having problems running cleanCache, set the MW_INSTALL_PATH environment variable.  E.g.
   
   0 0 * * * MW_INSTALL_PATH=/var/www/wiki /usr/bin/php /var/www/wiki/extension/SemanticResultFormats/Ploticus/SRF_Ploticus_cleanCache.php -v 2>&1 > /var/log/ploticus_cleanCache.log

 * $wgEnableUploads (default: false - this is a MediaWiki setting)
   - must be true. Be sure the upload directory has the proper permissions.  If you wish to use SRF-Ploticus without enabling uploads,
   you can manually create the 'ploticus' directory under the MW upload.  Further, under the ploticus directory, subdirectories from 0 to f hex
   (e.g. 0,1,2,3...9,a,b,c,d,e,f) should also be created, all with permission 777.
   (see http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:$wgUploadPath)

== Configuration and Usage ==

The SRF-ploticus Result Format has the following parameters:

 * ploticusmode (enum/optional)
   - set to 'prefab' (default) or 'script'
 
 * ploticusparams (string/required)
   - in prefab mode, this should be set to prefab cmdline parameters.
   Line endings can be used to split the prefab commandline for readability.
   
   In script mode, set to a ploticus script.  Line endings to separate directives
   can and should be used in script mode.  Otherwise, the ploticus script parser will fail.
        
 * imageformat (enum/optional)
   - png (default), gif, jpeg, svg, svgz, swf, eps, ps, drawdump, drawdumpa (drawdump append) and csv.
   Availability of format depends on how ploticus is built.  When using svgz, make sure Apache
   is configured properly, i.e. you have the svgz mime-type and svgz encoding.
        AddType image/svg+xml svg svgz
        AddEncoding gzip svgz
        
    The csv format is a special case.  It only generates the CSV result and sets showcsv=true (see below), and
    Ploticus is NOT actually invoked.
    
    This is useful in cases when the result set is very large and you want the ability to download the CSV file
    without bumping up against SMW and PHP memory limits.
    
    FYI, while the stock CSV result printer creates the file in memory, SRF-Ploticus streams the result directly to the filesystem.
    As a result, the resulting CSV file can be much bigger.
    
    As an added benefit, the CSV file is also persistent across sessions. That is, the generated URL for the CSV file is available
    without running the query, within bounds of the $srfgPloticusCacheAgeHours LocalSettings.php parameter.
        
 * alttext (string/optional)
   - alternate text displayed on mouseover for raster formats (PNG/JPEG/GIF). Ignored when client-side imagemap is generated.
   On vector formats (SVG/SVGZ/EPS/PS), alttext is prepended to the warning message if the browser is not capable of displaying
   the plot.
 
 * showcsv (bool/optional)
   - 0 (default). When 1, displays link to CSV file used to generate plot.  Beware that the CSV
   ALWAYS shows the latest query result, which may sometimes fall out of sync with the "cached" plot.
   (See liveupdating, showtimestamp & updatefrequency parameters below)
   
   Also note that the Inline query headers parameter influences how the CSV file is generated.
   If headers=show (default), a header row will be inserted.
   
   Keep in mind that most Ploticus prefabs automatically create legends when header=show is set.
   If you want to suppress legends, be sure to specify legend parameter accordingly.
   (http://ploticus.sourceforge.net/doc/prefab_stdparms.html#legend)
 
 * debug (bool/optional)
   - 0 (default). When 1, displays ploticus prefab cmdline or script used to generate plot.
   It also invokes ploticus itself in debug mode and creates a link to the debug file.
   Also turns showcsv on and bypasses the ploticus "cache".
        
 * liveupdating (bool/optional)
   - 1 (default). When 1, will check if the query result has changed and regenerate the plot if so.
   Otherwise, when 0, the plot will only be generated once and stored in the ploticus "cache", even
   if the query results have changed.

 * updatefrequency (secs/optional)
   - 3600 (default). Specifies how old a plot should be before its regenerated even if the underlying
   result data has not changed.
   If you do not want to "cache" a plot, set updatefrequency to 0.
    
 * showtimestamp (bool/optional)
   - 0 (default). Shows timestamp when the plot was last regenerated.
   Its recommended to set showtimestamp to 1 when liveupdating is 0 or when updatefrequency > 0.
   
 * showrefresh (bool/optional)
   - 0 (default).  Shows a Refresh link to force refresh of the WHOLE article.
   
 * showimagelink (bool/optional)
   - 0 (default).  Shows a link to open the plot image in a separate window.
   Especially useful for SVG and SWF file formats since they are scalable formats.

 * width (string/optional)
   - sets the width of the plot proper in pixel/percent units (e.g. 100, 80%).
   This is especially useful for vector formats (SWF, SVG, EPS, PS)
   
 * height (string/optional)
   - sets the height of the plot proper in pixel/percent units.
   This is especially useful for vector formats (SWF, SVG, EPS, PS)
   
 * tblwidth (string/optional)
   - sets the width of SRF-Ploticus result HTML table (which contains the plot) in pixel/percent units.
   If not set, the table will fit the width of the generated plot.  For vector formats (svg, svgz, swf),
   you may want to set this to "100%".
   
 * tblheight (string/optional)
   - sets the height of the SRF-Ploticus result HTML table in pixel/percent units.  Normally left unset.
   Remember that this is for the ENTIRE HTML table, which may include additional rows (action buttons/debug info)
   and not just for the plot image.
   
 * drawdumpoutput (string/optional)
   - this parameter is only processed in prefab mode when imageformat is set to drawdump or drawdumpa.
   (In script mode, use the %WORKINGDIR% keyword in your script when producing drawdumps)
   Specifies the filename to which the drawdump output will be stored in the ploticus cache directory.

PREFAB MODE
===========
In prefab mode, ploticusparams expects commandline parameters that one would normally use when
invoking stand-alone ploticus in prefab mode.

However, the following Ploticus commandline prefab parameters should NOT be specified:
 * data - automatically generated by the extension
 * output - automatically generated by the extension
 * format (e.g. -png, -gif, etc.) - use the SRF-ploticus imageformat parameter.
 * debug - use the SRF-Ploticus debug parameter instead
 
SCRIPT MODE
===========
In script mode, ploticusparams should be set to a ploticus script.

Two special keywords can be used in the script body (case-sensitive):
 * %DATAFILE.CSV% - replaced with fully qualified path to result CSV file generated by the inline query
 * %WORKINGDIR% - replaced with SRF-ploticus cache directory.  This is useful when creating drawdump/drawdumpa
   files in script mode.
 
For security reasons, the passed script is also "sanitized" and the following ploticus directives are disabled:
 * #include
 * #shell
 * #sql
 * #write
 * #cat
 
                                      ======= USAGE NOTES =========

Overlaying and combining plots from multiple queries
====================================================
By specifying drawdump or drawdumpa in the imageformat, you can overlay and/or combine plots from multiple
SRF-Ploticus queries into one graphic image / result.

Standard Ploticus drawdump processing practices should be used, that is:
 - the first query should use the drawdump imageformat and specify the SRF-Ploticus drawdumpoutput parameter
 to be used for the combined plot.
      
      ...
      ploticusmode=prefab
      imageformat=drawdump
      drawdumpoutput=mydump
      ploticusparams= -prefab scat "rectangle= 1 1 3 3" ....
      ...
 
 - subsequent queries should use the drawdumpa (drawdump append) imageformat, making sure to use the
 SAME drawdumpoutput SRF-Ploticus parameter as the first query.
 
      ...
      ploticusmode=prefab
      imageformat=drawdumpa
      drawdumpoutput=mydump
      ploticusparams= -prefab scat "rectangle= 4 1 6 3" ....
      ...
      
 - the last SRF-Ploticus call to display the combined plot should be a prefab draw command, e.g.
 
      ...
      ploticusmode=prefab
      imageformat=png
      ploticusparams= -prefab draw dumpfile=mydump
      ...
      
   where mydump is the name of the file passed to the drawdumpoutput parameter in the earlier SRF-Ploticus queries.


Imagemaps:
=========
Client-side imagemaps are automatically generated by SRF-Ploticus if it detects the clickmap directive.

Typically, imagemaps "links/labels" should be set to resolve to "Article URL/Article Name".
Note that imagemaps are only valid for PNG, GIF, JPEG and SVG.

However, Ploticus 2.40 currently uses plus signs (+) instead of underscores (_) when generating
clickmap URL targets.  This won't work in SMW.

A patch has been submitted to Steve Grubb (Ploticus creator) to change this behavior.
(http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/ploticus/message/2166).  A copy of the patch is also in the ploticus-addons directory.

At the moment, SRF-Ploticus corrects the clickmap URL targets for PNG, GIF and JPEG raster formats, swapping out the + for _.
SVG clickmaps will require the patch to work properly.

Once the patch is applied, a new PLOTICUS_CONFIG parameter is now available - encodeclickmapurls.  This should be set to
yes in the PLOTICUS_CONFIG file (e.g. encodeclickmapurls: yes).  See http://ploticus.sourceforge.net/doc/config.html.
