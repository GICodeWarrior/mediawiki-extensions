= Semantic Result Formats =

Semantic Result Formats is an extension to MediaWiki that bundles a number of
result formats for Semantic MediaWiki's inline queries. The individual formats
can be added to the installation independently. This file contains an
overview on how to install and configure the formats, as well as an overview
of all included formats.


== Installation ==

Copy all files into MediaWiki's extensions folder, either by using SVN or by
extracting an installation package. In order to include all available
result formats, you can simply add the following line to your code:

 require_once( 'path/to/extension/SRF_Settings.php' );

If you want to enable only some of the available formats, you have to declare
an array with all activated formats before including the file, e.g.

global $srfgFormats;
$srfgFormats = array('graph', 'googlebar');
require_once( 'path/to/extension/SRF_Settings.php' );

This will activate the graph and the google bar char format. The keywords
for the formats are given below.


== Included formats ==

=== calendar ===

=== timeline ===

per query result.

=== eventline ===

of individual dates per query result.
