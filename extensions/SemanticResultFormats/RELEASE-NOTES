== SRF 1.4.0 ==

Released on November 26 2008.

This is the initial release of Semantic Result Formats. The version number
was chosen in order to be aligned to the Semantic MediaWiki core distribution.
SRF 1.4.0 is compatible to SMW 1.4.0 and thus equally versioned.

The initial sets of Semantic Result Formats are:
* calendar (written by Yaron Koren)
* eventline (written by Markus Krötzsch and based on code by MIT's Simile group)
* googlebar (written by Denny Vrandecic)
* googlepie (written by Denny Vrandecic)
* graph (written by Frank Dengler)
* timeline (written by Markus Krötzsch and based on code by MIT's Simile group)

== SRF 1.4.1 ==

Released on December 9 2008.

The initialization of formats was changed to use the global $srfgFormats
variable, instead of the srfInit() function.

New formats in this version are:
* average (written by Yaron Koren)
* min (written by Yaron Koren)
* max (written by Yaron Koren)
* sum (written by Nathan Yergler)
