== Installation ==

Installation instructions are available online in a more convenient form for
reading at:
 http://semantic-mediawiki.org/wiki/Semantic_Result_Formats

Copy all files into MediaWiki's extensions folder, either by using SVN or by
extracting an installation package. You need to enter two lines to your local
settings (after the inclusion of Semantic MediaWiki). The first one is to
include the code:

 require_once( 'path/to/extension/SRF_Settings.php' );

If nothing else is added, no format will be included. In order to include a
format, add the following line to your local settings after the line above:
 srfInit( array('formatname', 'formatname', ...) );

with formatname being one of the following values (you can use as many
formatnames as you like):

  calendar, eventline, googlebar, googlepie, graph, timeline

So for example to enable graph, timeline and calendar you would write:

 srfInit( array('graph', 'timeline', 'calendar') );

You can also just use the following command to include all available formats:

 srfInit('all');

but this is not recommended since it may expand your system with formats that
do not follow certain policies within the wiki without you making that explicit
decision (consider that result formats may send data to external web services
for rendering which may be considered a data leak. For example, googlebar and
googlepie do this).

Notes on specific formats:
* Eventline: Eventline requires Javascript to render.
* Googlebar: note that Googlebar is sending data to Google for rendering.
  Googlebar requires access to the Google servers in order to render.
* Googlepie: note that Googlepie is sending data to Google for rendering.
  Googlepie requires access to the Google servers in order to render.
* Graph: in order to get the graph format to run you first have to have
  the graph extension up and running. The graph format is based on the
  MediaWiki Graph extension.
* Timeline: Eventline requires Javascript to render.
