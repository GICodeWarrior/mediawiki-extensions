== 1. Introduction ==

The Newest Pages extension adds an includable special page to MediaWiki which
produces an ordered list of the newest pages in the wiki, up to a specified
limit. The page can be accessed as a regular special page, or included within
other pages as a form of dynamic list.

== 2. Installing the extension ==

To install the Newest Pages extension, first upload/copy the extension file
NewestPages.php into your MediaWiki extensions directory. Then edit your
LocalSettings.php file and add the following line:

	require_once( 'extensions/NewestPages.php' );

Save the file (uploading if applicable) to complete the installation.

== 3. Accessing the special page ==

To access the special page in the regular view mode, go to Special:Newestpages
on your wiki, or select it from the list of special pages.

The page has a default limit of 50 items, which can be customised using the
supplied limit links, or with the 'limit' parameter in the page URL.

== 4. Including the special page ==

To include the special page into another page, add the following wiki markup
to that page:

	{{Special:Newestpages}}

This will be replaced with a list when the containing page is rendered. To
customise the limit here, use the following syntax:

	{{Special:Newestpages/X}}

where X is the desired limit.

== 5. Customising the interface text ==

All interface text used in the Newest Pages extension is customisable via
the MediaWiki namespace. See Special:Allmessages for a list of customisable
interface messages in the wiki.

== 6. Notes ==

This extension was written in a much more specific form to serve the needs of a
user in the #mediawiki IRC channel. Following a second request for a similar
page, I decided to clean up the code, give the page a more generalised function,
and release it.

Feedback welcomed at <robchur@gmail.com> as usual.
