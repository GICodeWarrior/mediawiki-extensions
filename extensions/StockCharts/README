The '''StockCharts''' extension allows users to include interactive
financial charts within an article. Charts cover stocks prices, but
also economic data such as the Consumer Price Index and interest rates,
along with prices for commodities such as oil, and currency exchange
rates. Charts are flash-powered and users can pan and zoom without a
page refresh. Data is provided by Thomson / Reuters and Xignite, with
a 15-20 minute delay.
