# Looking for WikiEditor or Vector extensions? They've been moved to extensions/WikiEditor and extensions/Vector
# respectively. These remaining extensions are being ported to either no longer depend on the now remove
# UsabilityInitiative.php code or to be made compatible with MediaWiki 1.17. For 1.16 compatible versions (which are no
# longer under active development but can be used to fixing bugs on existing deployments) please see the
# branches/usability-initiative-1_16/ (which has the latest patches) or the
# branches/REL1_16/extensions/UsabilityInitiative branch.

# PROGRESS ON WORK IN PROGRESS:
# * ClickTracking -- complete, depends on MediaWiki 1.17
# * DontSwitchMeOver -- complete, does not depend on MediaWiki 1.17
# * PrefStats -- complete, does not depend on MediaWiki 1.17
# * PrefSwitch -- incomplete/broken
# * UserDailyContribs -- complete, does not depend on MediaWiki 1.17

# Some lines to add to LocalSettings.php to get these extensions up and running:

# A system for making it easy for users to opt-in and out of a beta, in this
# case using vector as their skin and the enhanced toolbar
# NOTE: This extension may not be very useful for non-WMF wikis
require_once( "$IP/extensions/UsabilityInitiative/OptIn/OptIn.php" );
# Always show the link to opt-in in the personal tools - without this, the link
# to opt-out (while opted in) will still appear (it always does)
#$wgOptInAlwaysShowPersonalLink = true;

# Shows statistics on when users have started and ended using certain prefs

require_once("$IP/extensions/UsabilityInitiative/PrefStats/PrefStats.php");
$wgPrefStatsTrackPrefs = array( 'skin' => 'vector', 'usebetatoolbar' => 1 );
$wgGroupPermissions['sysop']['prefstats'] = true;
$wgPrefStatsTimeUnit = 60*60*24;

# Track users' contribution counts. ClickTracking (see below) needs this
# NOTE: This extension may not be very useful for non-WMF wikis
require_once( "$IP/extensions/UsabilityInitiative/UserDailyContribs/UserDailyContribs.php" );

# Track users' clicks in the toolbar and the left nav bar (and possibly other places as well)
# NOTE: This extension may not be very useful for non-WMF wikis
require_once("$IP/extensions/UsabilityInitiative/ClickTracking/ClickTracking.php");
# Click tracking is disabled by default. To enable it, use something like:
#$wgClickTrackThrottle = 10; // Track 1 in every 10 clicks; set to 1 to track all clicks, -1 to disable
