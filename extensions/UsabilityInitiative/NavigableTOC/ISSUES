* Script assumes lines only break on spaces, but in practice lines can also be
  broken mid-word on - / & etc.  This means the presence of such breaks (e.g.
  in URLs) causes the script to scroll down a few lines too few or too many.
  Especially the latter is very confusing.
* Script assumes the letters in the textarea are 8x16 (Windows), 8x13 (Mac) or
  7x15 (Linux), but these values should really be determined dynamically.
** Both of these can be avoided by determining the caret position properly,
   I'll ask Michael Dale about this.
