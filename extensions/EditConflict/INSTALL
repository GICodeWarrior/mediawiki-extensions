MediaWiki extension EditConflict, version 0.4.2

Extract an archive with extension to your wiki extensions directory.

Place the following lines to the "extensions section" of LocalSettings.php:

require_once( "$IP/extensions/EditConflict/EditConflict.php" );
EditConflict::$groupWeights[<usergroupname>] = <weight_of_group>;

Login as wiki sysop and open Special:Currentedits page to initialize
extension's database tables.

Default value of EditConflict::$groupWeights =
Array( '*' => 1, 'user' => 2, 'bureaucrat' => 3, 'sysop' => 4 );

where the key <usergroupname> of array is name of group, value is weight of the user group.
Members of lower weight groups will be denied to edit the page in case another user
already edits it.

Place the following line to LocalSettings.php:

EditConflict::$groupWeights['*'] = 0;

to set anonymous group weight = 0.

Zero is special lowest possible value of weight that disables AJAX watching loop
for editing sessions, which makes such edits to be invisible in Special:CurrentEdits page.
However, such edits are not blocking another edits of the same page, and may reduce
the server load (no AJAX / DB calls).

Use the following setting:
EditConflict::$useEditPageMergeChangesHook = true;

and patch 'includes/EditPage.php', by replacing the following text:

if ( $this->mergeChangesInto( $text ) ) {
to:
if ( $this->mergeChangesInto( $text ) || wfRunHooks( 'EditPageMergeChanges', array( $this, $text ) ) ) {

to enable extra functionality.
