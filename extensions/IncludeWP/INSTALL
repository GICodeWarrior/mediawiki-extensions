Extension page on mediawiki.org: http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:Include_WP
Latest version of the install file: http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/trunk/extensions/IncludeWP/INSTALL?view=co


== Download ==

You can find the current version of Include WP on the [https://code.google.com/p/includewp/downloads/list Google Code download page],
as well as a [https://code.google.com/p/includewp/downloads/list?can=1 list of legacy downloads].

You can also get the code directly from SVN. Tags can be obtained via

 svn checkout <nowiki>http://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/mediawiki/tags/extensions/IncludeWP/REL_version</nowiki>

Where 'version' is the version number of the tag, such as 0_1 (see the [http://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/mediawiki/tags/extensions/IncludeWP/ available tags]).
The latest code can be obtained from trunk:

 svn checkout <nowiki>http://svn.wikimedia.org/svnroot/mediawiki/trunk/extensions/IncludeWP/</nowiki>

IncludeWP requires [[Extension:Validator|Validator]] 0.4.2 or above in order to work. A compatible
copy of Validator always comes bundled with the regular releases, and is automatically loaded by IncludeWP,
so you do not need to worry about it when using one of these. If you are getting the code from SVN, make
sure you also get a copy of Validator ([[Extension:Validator#Download|see here for instructions]]).

== Installation ==

Once you have downloaded the code, place the ''IncludeWP'' and ''Validator'' directories within your
MediaWiki 'extensions' directory. Then add the following code to your [[Manual:LocalSettings.php|LocalSettings.php]] file:

# IncludeWP
require_once( "$IP/extensions/IncludeWP/IncludeWP.php" );

== Configuration ==

Configuration of IncludeWP is done by adding simple PHP statements to your [[Manual:LocalSettings.php|LocalSettings.php]]
file. These statements need to be placed AFTER the inclusion of IncludeWP. The options are listed below and their default
is set in the [http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/trunk/extensions/IncludeWP/IncludeWP.settings.php?view=markup Include WP settings file].
You should NOT modify the settings file, but can have a look at it to get an idea of how to use the  settings, in case the below descriptions do not suffice.

As of version 0.1, there are no settings yet.
