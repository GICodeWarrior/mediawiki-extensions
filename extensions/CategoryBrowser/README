MediaWiki extension CategoryBrowser, version 0.3.1

CategoryBrowser is an AJAX-enabled category filter and browser for MediaWiki.
Categories can be filtered with pre-defined and also with used-defined conditions.
User-defined conditions can be edited by using Javascript-based interface.
Currently applied used-defined condition is stored in user's cookie for future use.
Categories also can be filtered by first letters in their names.
AJAX-browser implements recursive browsing for categories, but also shows pages
and files as well. Categories, pages and files are browsed with limit count, to
reduce the resource consumption.
