# Enhancements to the Vector skin
#
# This is a MediaWiki 1.17+ compatible version of the former UsabilityInitiative/Vector extension. The key differences
# between these versions is in the usage of ResourceLoader.
#
# To get this working on your wiki

require_once( "$IP/extensions/Vector/Vector.php" );

# Before configuring this extension, see Vector.php and become familiar with the initial state and structure of the
# $wgVectorFeatures configuration variable. Essentially it's an array or arrays, keyed by feature name, each containing
# global and user keys with boolean values. "global" indicates that it should be turned on for everyone always, while
# user indicates that users should be allowed to turn it on or off in their user preferences.

# To enable a preference by default but still allow users to disable it in preferences, use something like...

$wgDefaultUserOptions['vector-collapsiblenav'] = 1;

# By default, the Vector skin does not use the simplified serach box. To take advantage of the simplesearch feature you
# must add this to your LocalSettings.php file.

$wgVectorUseSimpleSearch = true;
