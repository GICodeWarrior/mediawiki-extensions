== 1. Introduction ==

The username blacklist extension is an add-on to the MediaWiki software which
allows wiki administrators and other users with appropriate permissions to
maintain a "blacklist" of usernames which cannot be registered. This blacklist
is checked against and enforced during new account creation.

Privileged users are permitted to override the blacklist when creating accounts
manually. By default, this permission is available to sysops, but can be
restricted further or removed to prevent any override.

The blacklist accepts simple text and more powerful regular expressions, for
matching against particular patterns of usernames.

== 2. Requirements ==

The username blacklist extension requires MediaWiki 1.5.8 or above.

== 3. Installing the Extension ==

To install the extension, place all extension files in a "UsernameBlacklist"
directory within your MediaWiki extensions directory, then edit
LocalSettings.php and add the following line:

	require_once( "{$IP}/extensions/UsernameBlacklist.php" );

== 4. Editing the Blacklist ==

The username blacklist extension looks for a system message named 
"usernameblacklist" in your wiki. This can usually be edited via the
MediaWiki:Usernameblacklist page. You will need to create this page, and format
it as a bulleted list with each blocked username or regular expression as a new
list item. For example:

* Foo
* [Bb]ar

The example above would prevent creation of usernames containing "Foo",
"Bar" or "bar".

Lines without the list token (*) will be ignored when constructing the
regular expression, which allows for adding comments or other explanations
to the message page.

== 5. Customising Warning Messages ==

When a user attempts to create an account with a blacklisted username, they
receive a warning message. The text of this can be customised via two system
messages:

* MediaWiki:Blacklistedusername
	The heading text
	
* MediaWiki:Blacklistedusernametext
	Explanatory text
	
== 6. Further Reading ==

As noted above, the extension supports regular expression text matching on
usernames. I won't go into more detail about this here (and I have given an
example above), but I'll provide a couple of useful links:
