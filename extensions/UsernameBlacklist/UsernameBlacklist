== 1. Introduction ==

The username blacklist extension is an add-on to the MediaWiki software which
allows wiki administrators and other users with appropriate permissions to
maintain a "blacklist" of usernames which cannot be registered. This blacklist
is checked against and enforced during new account creation.

The blacklist accepts simple text and more powerful regular expressions, for
matching against particular patterns of usernames.

== 2. Installing the Extension ==

To install the username blacklist extension, first upload/copy the extension 
file UsernameBlacklist.php into your MediaWiki extensions directory. Then edit
your LocalSettings.php file and add the following line:

	require_once( 'extensions/UsernameBlacklist.php' );
	
Save the file (uploading if applicable) to complete the installation.

== 3. Editing the Blacklist ==

The username blacklist extension looks for a system message named 
"usernameblacklist" in your wiki. This can usually be edited via the
MediaWiki:Usernameblacklist page. You will need to create this page, and format
it as a bulleted list with each blocked username or regular expression as a new
list item. For example:

* Foo
* ((B|b)ar)

The example above would prevent creation of the user account "Foo", and any
account where the username contains "Bar" or "bar".

You can comment out lines with #; this is useful for adding explanation as to
what a complicated regular expression will block, or for providing reasons.

== 4. Customising Warning Messages ==

When a user attempts to create an account with a blacklisted username, they
receive a warning message. The text of this can be customised via two system
messages:

* MediaWiki:Blacklistedusername
	The heading text
	
* MediaWiki:Blacklistedusernametext
	Explanatory text
	
== 5. Further Reading ==

As noted above, the extension supports regular expression text matching on
usernames. I won't go into more detail about this here (and I have given an
example above), but I'll provide a couple of useful links:
