INSTALLATION
------------

This is an extension for the collaborative editing of LaTeX documents.
Installation is by the usual method, put the following line in your
LocalSettings.php:

    require_once( "extensions/LatexDoc/LatexDoc.php" );

This creates an object called $wgLatexDoc. Member variables of that object can
be changed in order to customise the behaviour of the extension.

    latexCommand
        Path to the latex command
    pdflatexCommand
        Path to the pdflatex command. This must be installed, otherwise the PDF
        links won't work.
    workingDir
        Filesystem directory where all related files go. Must be in the web
        server document root.
    workingPath
        Relative URI of workingDir

All of these variables have sensible defaults, as long as latex and pdflatex are
in the PATH, it should work out of the box.

USE
---

The extension operates by searching the text of articles at render time for
"\begin{document}". If this string is present, the article is not rendered like
ordinary wikitext. Instead, it's displayed with a fixed-width font, with a
"Make DVI" and a "Make PDF" link at the top. Clicking on the links will invoke
latex, generate the requested file, and redirect the browser to it.

SECURITY
--------

Executing LaTeX documents written by untrusted users is a security risk. I've put
in a simple filter for some obviously dangerous control words, but there may well be
holes. No guarantee is made. If you're brave enough to make a wiki with this
extension publically editable, it's recommended that you run latex from a chroot
jail.
