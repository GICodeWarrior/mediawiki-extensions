== Disclaimer ==

Semantic Drilldown is a new extension, and there is no
guarantee that any of it will work on your system. However, it does
not make any modifications to the database, other than creating
temporary database tables that are deleted soon afterwards, so it
should be a low-risk installation.

For a proper legal disclaimer, see the file "COPYING".

== Requirements ==

The extension requires an install of Semantic MediaWiki 0.6 or
greater. For more details, see Semantic MediaWiki's own
installation requirements.

== Installation ==

(1) Extract the archive to obtain the directory "SemanticDrilldown"
    that contains all relevant files. Copy this directory (or
    extract/download it) to "[wikipath]/extensions/".
(2) Insert the following line into the file "[wikipath]/LocalSettings.php":
      include_once('extensions/SemanticDrilldown/includes/SD_Settings.php');

'''Remark:'''  Semantic Drilldown creates an additional custom namespace,
"Filter" (see http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Custom_namespaces). If
you have your own custom namespaces, you have to set the parameter
$sdgNamespaceIndex before including SD_Settings.php. See SD_Settings.php
for more details.
