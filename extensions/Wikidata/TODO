Features
===============

* save defined meaning
* copy defined meaning
	* complete
	* robust
	* debug
* Conceptmapper will use specialsuggest


General Tidying (refactoring)
==================
* Start making use of recordhelpers
* Refurbish the attribute system

Deferred Items (take into account)
==================================

* ArrayRecord has a getItem method that SHOULD use attributes
  but currently cheats and allows one to access any stored item
  by key. This should be revisited when the attribute system
  is refurbished.

Unit Testing
=========================
* Extend unit testing framework to also safely test on its own database.
  Since wikidata is somewhat database based, this should allow testing
  of a majority of the code.
