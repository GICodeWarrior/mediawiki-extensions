1) Load an expression with multiple DMs and annotation, e.g.,
Expression:Dog. Check if all data is loaded correctly.

annotation, work. [This will become obsolete soon.]

3) Click on a DM and edit.

4) Add a new syntrans record and save.

5) Visit Special:Transaction (can be loaded in a new tab). Has your change
been recorded in the transaction log?

6) Remove the new syntrans record and save.

7) Add a "string property" example sentence to one of the syntrans records.
Was the ata added correctly? You may also remove it.

8) Call all "Wikidata:" special pages (from Special:Specialpages) and verify
their basic function.

9) Navigate between different data-sets.

10) Click the "history" tab on a DM. Does it work? Can old versions be
