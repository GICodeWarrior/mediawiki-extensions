Hmmm, oops, got my view and  controller tangled...
I should have made the view an observer of the model instead... <sigh>

And then I now realize I'd have a clear state to work with.

Well, live and learn. Will try and fix that when going for feature completion
there's stuff that'd give me headaches otherwise.
