== About ==

'Subpage Fun' provides your wiki with seven new parser functions/variables to get information about subpages [0]
you can't get with MediaWikis existing magic Words. Also, this extension has a slightly different concept about
what is considered a subpage than MediaWikis existing functions.

MediaWikis existing subpage functions just define a subpage as the part behind a slash ('/'). This extension goes
one step further and says that a page is only then a subpage when a parent page exists. This means a page 'AC/DC'
won't be a subpage as long as the page 'AC' doesn't exist. Assuming the page 'AC/DC/Discography' exists, the page
'AC/DC/Discography/1975/1976' would have the '{{SUBPAGETITLE}}' '1975/1976'. The MediaWiki '{{SUBPAGENAME}}'
variable instead would only output '1976' in this case which is nonsense since this page doesn't even exist.

The following can be used as MediaWiki variables '{{SUBPAGES}}' for the current page, or as parser functions for a
specific page ''{{SUBPAGES:page}}'', some even with additional parameters.

 SUBPAGETITLE:
 The real name of a subpage, not only the part behind the last slash ('/') like MediaWiki's SUBPAGENAME outputs it.
 
 SUBPAGES:
 Outputs all Subpages as a comma separated list. This means all descendant pages, not only direct child pages. The
 output has no specific order.
 
 PARENTPAGES:
 Outputs all ancestor pages as a comma separated list. The output begins with the top level page and ends with the
 direct parent page.
 
 SIBLINGPAGES:
 Outputs all sibling pages of the same subpage level and tree as a comma separated list (without specific order).
 
 SUBPAGELEVEL:
 The subpage level of a page. A normal page which is no subpage at all would return '0'.
 
 NUMBEROFSUBPAGES:
 How many subpages does a page have. Also works with subpages to see how many subpages they have. Counts all
 descendant pages, not only direct child pages.
 
 TOPLEVELPAGE:
 The top level page which is the page with subpage level 0 within the same subpage tree.


== Installation ==

directory. Then add the following code to your [[Manual:LocalSettings.php|LocalSettings.php]] file:
