This is the readme file for AjaxLogin extension.
The newest documentation for this extension can always be found at
<http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:AjaxLogin>.

==History==
AjaxLogin was written by Inez Korczy≈Ñski <korczynski(at)gmail(dot)com> for
Wikia, Inc.

Some code hacks were written by Jack Phoenix <jack@countervandalism.net>.

Replaced YUI with jQuery - Chamindu Munasinghe <chamindu@calcey.com>.

==License==
GNU General Public License 2.0 or later

==Dependency==
jQuery

==Manual modifications==
You will need to modify one core MediaWiki file, includes/EditPage.php, if you
want users to be able to log in with AjaxLogin on edit view (?action=edit)
without losing their changes.

Find protected function showFormBeforeText() and add this line inside the
$wgOut->addHTML() call so that it'll be the first <input> to be added:

	<input type='hidden' value=\"\" name=\"wpLogin\" id=\"wpLogin\" />

==To-do & bugs==
Patches are more than welcome and they can be submitted either through Bugzilla
<https://bugzilla.wikimedia.org> or emailed to me <jack@countervandalism.net>
directly.
