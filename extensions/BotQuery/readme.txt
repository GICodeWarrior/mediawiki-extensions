== Installation ==
* Place all files into your w/extensions/botquery directory
* DO NOT modify any other files (like LocalSettings.php) - it is not needed
* Optionally make a symbolic link query.php in w/ dir to point to 
wiki/extenions/query.php to allow access via http://site/w/query.php
Note: Query API depends on being two levels beneath the root of the wiki.

This extension came as the result of IRC discussion between Yuri Astrakhan (en:Yurik), 
Tim Starling (en:Tim Starling), and Daniel Kinzler(de:Duesentrieb)
The extension was first implemented by Tim to provide interlanguage links and history summary.
It was later completely rewritten by Yuri, introducing the rest of properties, meta information, 
and various formatting options.
