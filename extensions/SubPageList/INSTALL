== Installation ==

Once you have downloaded the code, place the ''SubPageList'' and ''Validator'' directories within your
MediaWiki 'extensions' directory. Then add the following code to your [[Manual:LocalSettings.php|LocalSettings.php]] file:

<source lang="php">
# SubPageList
require_once( "$IP/extensions/SubPageList/SubPageList.php" );
</source>

== Configuration ==

Configuration of SubPageList is done by adding simple PHP statements to your [[Manual:LocalSettings.php|LocalSettings.php]]
file. These statements need to be placed AFTER the inclusion of SubPageList. The options are listed below and their default
is set in the [http://svn.wikimedia.org/viewvc/mediawiki/trunk/extensions/SubPageList/SubPageList.settings.php?view=markup SubPageList settings file].
You should NOT modify the settings file, but can have a look at it to get an idea of how to use the  settings, in case the below descriptions do not suffice.
