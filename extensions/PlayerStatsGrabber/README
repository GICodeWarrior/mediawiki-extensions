Player Stats Grabber

== Overview == 
Player Stats Grabber is a simple survey and player stats collector. 

config variables: 
$psLogEveryPlayRequestPerUser: 
when set to true we log every play request 
when set to false we only log play request from different users (users are calculated as different by their $wgUser->getName() ) 

player_stats_survey:
The survey loosely ties survey questions with a logged submitted play request.

player_stats_log:
It collects browser stats from anybody that clicks play on a oggHandler embed. It also runs on the survey page for when the client is a flash player. 

This extension is dependent on OggHandler and must be enabled via a config variable in the oggHanlder line (although it does not have to run on the same server as oggHandler.
