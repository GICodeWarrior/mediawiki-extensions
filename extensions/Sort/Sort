== 1. Introduction ==

The Sort extension facilitates the simplified creation and editing of
sorted lists and adds a new tag to the MediaWiki markup, <sort>.

The sort direction and type of list (unordered/ordered) can be customised.

== 2. Installation requirements ==

This extension has been developed to work with MediaWiki 1.7. It should also
work fine with the 1.6 release branch. Behaviour cannot be guaranteed under
MediaWiki 1.5.x or earlier versions of the software.

== 3. Installing the extension ==

To install the Sort extension, place the extension file Sort.php into your
MediaWiki extensions directory, then edit your LocalSettings.php file and
add the following line:

	require_once( 'extensions/Sort.php' );

Save the file to complete the installation, which can be verified through
the Special:Version page on the wiki.

== 4. Using the extension ==

Sort adds a new tag, <sort>, to the MediaWiki markup, which can be inserted
while editing. The syntax of this tag is:

	<sort order="[order]" class="[class]">
	List item one
	List item two
	etc.
	</sort>

The order and class attributes are optional, and are used to customise the
sort direction and list type generated. By default, Sort will generate an
alphabetically sorted unordered list. Each item in the list should go on
a new line. Wiki markup can be used.

The following are valid order values

* asc - ascending sort (default)
* desc - descending sort

The following are valid class values

* ul - unordered [bulleted] list (default)
* ol - ordered [numbered] list
