SORT EXTENSION

	Version 1.1
	Â© 2006-2007 Rob Church

The Sort extension introduces a <sort> tag to MediaWiki markup, which
simplifies the creation of sorted lists. The sort direction and
list type can be customised.

== Requirements ==

The Sort extension requires MediaWiki 1.7.0 or later.

== Installation ==

1. Check out all extension files from Subversion and place them in a
   "MinimumNameLength" subdirectory within your MediaWiki "extensions"
   directory
2. Add the line
   require_once( "{$IP}/extensions/MinimumNameLength/MinimumNameLength.php" );
   to your LocalSettings.php file

Installation can be verified through the [[Special:Version]] page on the wiki.

== Using the extension ==

Sort adds a new tag, <sort>, to the MediaWiki markup, which can be inserted
while editing. The syntax of this tag is:

	<sort order="[order]" class="[class]">
	List item one
	List item two
	etc.
	</sort>

The order and class attributes are optional, and are used to customise the
sort direction and list type generated. By default, Sort will generate an
alphabetically sorted unordered list. Each item in the list should go on
a new line.

Wiki links can be used; list tokens (i.e. # and *) will be trimmed.

The following are valid order values

* asc - ascending sort (default)
* desc - descending sort

The following are valid class values

* ul - unordered [bulleted] list (default)
* ol - ordered [numbered] list
