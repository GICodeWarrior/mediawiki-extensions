This is the mediaWiki version of the mwEmbed library.

The core components are svn:externals from the stand alone mwEmbed library. 

The loader.js does not include any default modules since in mediaWiki javascript modules live in extensions.

If an extension module becomes widely reused we could potentially move it into the /modules folder in mwEmbed.
