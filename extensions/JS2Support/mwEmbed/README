This is the mediaWiki version of the mwEmbed library.

This is a subset of the stand alone mwEmbed library. 

The loader.js does not include any default modules since in mediaWiki javascript modules loader paths are
defined in extensions.

If an extension module becomes widely reused we could potentially move it into the /modules folder in mwEmbed.
