== Overview ==

The Automatic Groups extension provides a convenient means to configure
additional automatic rights and user group membership for users matching
specific criteria.

Rights and groups can be added based on

	* account age
	* edit count
	
The extension requires MediaWiki 1.11.0 or above.
	
== Configuration ==

Group criteria are set using the $wgAutomaticGroups global, which is an
array mapping group names to an array of criteria. Rights criteria are
set using $wgAutomaticRights, which has the same format.

The criteria are indexed by attribute, mapping to the minimum value
required for that criterion.

Valid criteria are:

	* 'edits'
		Minimum edit count
	* 'age'
		Account age (in seconds)
		
=== Examples ===

To assign the group 'uploaders' to all accounts at least 4 days old, one
might use

	$wgAutomaticGroups['uploaders'] = array( 'age' => 86400 * 4 );
	
To assign the 'delete' right to all accounts at least 4 days old
with at least 250 edits, one might use

	$wgAutomaticRights['delete'] = array( 'age' => 86400 * 4, 'edits' => 250 );
