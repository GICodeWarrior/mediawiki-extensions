== Overview ==

The Automatic Groups extension provides a convenient means to configure
additional automatic groups for users matching specific criteria.

Groups can be added based on

	* account age
	* edit count
	
== Configuration ==

Group criteria are set using the $wgAutomaticGroups global, which is an
array mapping group names to an array of criteria.

The criteria are indexed by attribute, mapping to the minimum value
required for that criterion. Multiple criteria are supported per group.

Valid criteria are

	* 'edits'
		Minimum edit count
	* 'age'
		Account age (in seconds)
		
=== Examples ===

To assign the group 'uploaders' to all accounts at least 4 days old, one
might use

	$wgAutomaticGroups['uploaders'] = array( 'age' => 86400 * 4 );
	
To assign the group 'patrollers' to all accounts at least 4 days old
with at least 250 edits, one might use

	$wgAutomaticGroups['patrollers'] = array( 'age' => 86400 * 4, 'edits' => 250 );
