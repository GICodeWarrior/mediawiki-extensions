== About ==

Spark is a JavaScript library that allows the simple integration of data from all
over the Web in any HTML page, using a rich set of visualizations. This extension
enabled embedding of spark mashups using <code><nowiki><spark /></nowiki></code> tags.

Spark as described on the Spark website:

	The web is not only growing in sheer size, but it also grows in how much it is
	interconnected. Where once the Web was a set of more or less separated sites,
	today sites are more and more being connected. More and more data is being
	offered on the Web in a way that can be further processed, and more and more
	sites and applications are using external data. More and more mashups are created,
	where data from different sources is integrated and displayed with novel visualisations.
	
	Spark is a library that enables HTML authors to create mashups more easily than
	ever before. Using standard Web technologies like SPARQL, RDF, HTML5, and JavaScript,
	Spark can query external knowledge sources (so called triple stores or SPARQL endpoints),
	and then visualise the results.
	
	With Spark, website developers can create visually appealing mashups without having to
	write a single line of JavaScript, but merely using some markup elements describing the
	source of the data that is to be shown, a query to select the appropriate data, and
	selecting one from an expandable set of visualisations and their parameters.

This MediaWiki extension, unsurprisingly titled Spark, adds a <code><nowiki><spark></nowiki></code> tag to MediaWiki
which is equivalent to <code><nowiki><div class=”spark”></nowiki></code> as described in the spark library documentation.
All parameters (except the class=”spark” one) can just be copied over between spark divs
in web pages, and the <code><nowiki><spark></nowiki></code> tag in MediaWiki.

=== Feature overview ===

* Visualization of data obtained via SPARQL queries.
* Support for all Spark visualizations.
* Use of the native Spark syntax, which can be copied from native spark divs to the spark tag and back.

==== Adding of additionally required JavaScript files ====
* Some visualizations of Spark require additional JavaScript files.
* Those can be defined in modules, see Spark.settings.php - Example configuration modules

==== Support for MW versions without Resource Loader ====
* Here, the native Spark syntax cannot be used, completely. 
* E.g, instead of data-spark-endpoint, one needs to have only endpoint.
