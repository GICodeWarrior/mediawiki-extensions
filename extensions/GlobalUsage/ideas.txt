When using a shared image repository, it is impossible to see within MediaWiki whether a file
is used on one of the slave wikis. On Wikimedia this is handled by the CheckUsage tool on the 
toolserver, but it is merely a hack of function that should be built in.

GlobalUsage creates a new table globalimagelinks, which is basically the same as imagelinks, but 
points to the usage on foreign wikis. The field il_from has been replaced by gil_wiki, gil_page
and gil_pagename, which contain respectively the interwiki prefix, page id and page name 
including namespace of the linking page. Since the foreign wiki may use different namespaces ,
the namespace name needs to be included in the link as well.

GlobalUsage hooks a to be created hook LinksUpdate, which is run after LinksUpdater:doUpdate.
It will get the image usage diffs, for each image gets the repo, groups them by repo, and 
updates the link table on the repo. 

It should also hook ImageUpload and ArticleDelete, since those also influence the imagelinks,
without LinksUpdater being run.

The GlobalUsage can be found on Special:GlobalUsage. Or should it be included on the image 
description page?
