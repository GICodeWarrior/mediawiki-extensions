XMLRC is designed to push notifications about changes on the wiki to listeners,
in a way that makes it easy to process this information. To this end, XMLRC
sends UDP-packets containing XML formated notifications. The XML contains
<rc>-tags exactly like those generated by the web API  when asked to list
recentchanges. This way, anyone interested in changes on the wiki can simply
listen to these notifications instead of constantly polling the web API.

Detailed documentation is available at
<http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:XMLRC>.

XMLRC itself will only emit UDP packets, but it comes with some extra components
that allow the use of XMPP for transport:

* A UDP to XMPP bridge, udp2xmpp.py, located in the directory 'bridge'. See
<http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:XMLRC/udp2xmpp.py> for details.
* XMPP client library, aware of the extra RC data in the XMPP messages,
rcclient.py, located in the directory 'client'. See
<http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:XMLRC/rcclient.py> for details.
* A UDP generator for testing, rc2udp.py, located in the directory 'generator'.
See <http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:XMLRC/rc2udp.py> for details.

TODO:
* Add a utility to easily create MUC rooms for publishing RC events
* Add support for XMPP PubSub, which is more suitable for this application than
  MUC. However, PubSub is complex, not supported by all servers and only by a
  few client libraries.
* Implement service that allows arbitrary queries to the MediaWiki API via
  Jabber (using iq requests, perhaps?)
* use an XML namespace on the <rc> tag, see bugzilla:24781
* improve support for nested tags in rcclient.RecentChange
