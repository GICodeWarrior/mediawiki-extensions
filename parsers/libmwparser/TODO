- Memory leak in php api: the reference count on the input string must
  be decreased when the input stream is closed.  (API flaw.)
- Media link attributes
- html pre
- hr-tag
- img-tag
- parser options
  + __NOTOC__, __FORCETOC__ etc. passed from the preprocessor.
- red/blue links. 
  + It would be possible to make a lookup for all internal links after
    the lexer has made its run, to enable the parser to generate 
    "redlink" and "bluelink" actions directly.
- link prefix/suffixes.  Pass as arguments to the listener functions.
- The lexer should generate heading anchors.
