= WikiDom and Edit Surface =

WikiDom is a serializable document object model for Wikitext. Once a parser is created that can emit
a WikiDom structure, EditSurface will be usable as a visual editor for Wikitext. EditSurface is a
WikiDom compatible visual editor, which departs from HTML ContentEditable-based editors and uses
the HTML DOM to render the entire document and editing user interface elements.

== DOM Specification ==

Once parsed, Wikitext is stored in a syntax-agnostic structured form. This structure is built from
a variety of objects.

; Document
: A series of one or more blocks.
; Block
: A discreet portion of a document, such as a paragraph, list or table.
; Line
: A single line of text with annotation information to describe formatting, rendering and meaning.
; Item
: A line of text and optionally a series of nested lists.

=== Blocks ===

; Paragraph
: A series of line objects.
; List
: A series of item objects.
; Table
: A series of rows, each a series of columns, which contain document objects.

=== Representation ===
Below is a naive representation for the above explanations.
<pre>
Document
 |-> ParagraphBlock
 |    |-> Line
 |    |-> Line
 |    \-> ...
 |
 |-> ListBlock
 |    |-> Item
 |    |-> Item
 |    \-> ...
 |
 \-> Table
      |-> Row
      |    |-> Column
      |    |     \-> Document
      |    |-> Column
      |    |     \-> Document
      |    \-> ...
      |-> Row
      \-> ...
</pre>

== EditSurface ==

EditSurface is a proof-of-concept for rendering a structured and formatted text editor. The document
structure is from WikiDOM, and should be kept compatible as WikiDOM changes.

=== Design ===

A document is made up of a series of blocks, each with unique data structures and user interfaces.
These blocks may be paragraphs, lists, tables, etc. Within a block, the most common atomic element
is a line of text. Within a line of text, annotations can be applied which will affect it's
rendering. Additionally, discreet in-line objects can be used within a line. These items are treated
as a single character during selection, and are modified using a supplemental user interface such as
a dialog or inspector.

=== Plans ===

* Add table editor
