== DOM Specification ==

Once parsed, Wikitext is stored in a syntax-agnostic structured form. This structure is built from
a variety of objects.

; Document
: A series of one or more blocks.
; Block
: A discreet portion of a document, such as a paragraph, list or table.
; Line
: A single line of text with annotation information to describe formatting, rendering and meaning.
; Item
: A line of text and optionally a series of nested lists.

=== Blocks ===

; Paragraph
: A series of line objects.
; List
: A series of item objects.
; Table
: A series of rows, each a series of document objects.
