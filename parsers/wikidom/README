== DOM Specification ==

Once parsed, Wikitext is stored in a syntax-agnostic structured form. This structure is built from
a variety of objects.

; Document
: A series of one or more blocks.
; Block
: A discreet portion of a document, such as a paragraph, list or table.
; Line
: A single line of text with annotation information to describe formatting, rendering and meaning.
; Item
: A line of text and optionally a series of nested lists.

=== Blocks ===

; Paragraph
: A series of line objects.
; List
: A series of item objects.
; Table
: A series of rows, each a series of columns, which contain document objects.

== EditSurface ==

EditSurface is a proof-of-concept for rendering a structured and formatted text editor. The document
structure is from WikiDOM, and should be kept compatible as WikiDOM changes. 

=== Design ===

A document is made up of a series of blocks, each with unique data structures and user interfaces.
These blocks may be paragraphs, lists, tables, etc. Within a block, the most common atomic element
is a line of text. Within a line of text, annotations can be applied which will affect it's
rendering. Additionally, discreet in-line objects can be used within a line. These items are treated
as a single character during selection, and are modified using a supplemental user interface such as
a dialog or inspector.

=== Plans ===

* Re-flow lines without deleting paragraph elements
* Auto-update selection on resize
* Handle keyboard input for moving cursor and making selection
* Handle keyboard input for inserting and deleting
* Support multiple font styles in the same paragraph
* Support "black-box" in-line elements, treat them as a single character
* Add list editor
* Add table editor
