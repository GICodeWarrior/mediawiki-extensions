This demo was a proof of concept. It helped guide the design of the EditSurface code, but also
revealed some dead-ends.

Lessons learned:
* Browsers apply kerning to text, making it impossible utilize caching when measuring the width of
  rendered text without sacrificing accuracy.
* Pre-calculating metrics is not critical to the problem, since we flow more often than we request
  metrics for cursor placement or selection painting.
