  - com/fluendo:   Source code written by Fluendo
    - utils:       utitity classes used by jst, jheora, examples
    - jst:         a java port of the GStreamer 0.10 design
    - jheora:      a java implementation of the Theora video codec
    - jkate:       a basic java implementation of the Kate codec

    - codecs:      additional codecs; currently contains the Smoke codec
    - plugin:      plugins implementing/wrapping sources/decoders/sinks
    - examples:    example programs

- stubs:           stubs that contain minimal definitions for other classes
                   to allow compilation
  - sun/audio:     stubs for sun.audio.*
  - javax/sound:
    - sampled:     stubs for javax.sound.sampled.*

- output:          files generated as part of the build
  - build:         built class files
    - debug:       debug build
    - release:     release build
  - dist:          resulting jar files
    - debug:       debug versions of all cortado .jars
    - release:     release versions of all cortado .jars
    - applets:     all applet jars
    - src:         source distributions


NOTES
-----
- from the ant build file, we should be able to:
  - make a tarball with all the source and build stuff:
    "ant dist" (done)
  - generate the separate jars
    "ant jar-jcraft ..."
  - build the examples
  - generate stripped and debug versions of the applets, with specific plugins
    included
    "ant applets" or "ant applet-ovt applet-mmjs"
    "ant applets-debug"

- the plan is to:
  - build com.fluendo.utils in a jar
  - build com.jcraft in a jar
  - build com.fluendo.jheora in a jar (relying on jcraft and utils jars)
  - build com.fluendo.jst in a jar (relying on utils)
  - build com.fluendo.plugin into a jar (all combined, relying on all above)

- FIXME: what to do with the examples ?
