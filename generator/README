This directory contains rc2udp.py, a program that polls the MediaWiki
web API for recent-changes records, and sends them on as UDP packets.

This emuates the behavior of the XMLRC extension using UDP transport. 
It exissts purely for testing, for production use, the XMLRC extension
should be configured to emit UDP packets from the wiki iteself.

NOTE: You can place this directory anywhere on your system. In fact, for
security reasons, it is recommended to move it to a location that is not
accessible from the web or by the web server.

To use rc2udp.py, you need python 2.5 and the xmpppy library from 
<http://xmpppy.sourceforge.net/>. You also need an account on an XMPP
(Jabber) server for use by udp2xmpp.py. 

You can start rc2udp.py simply by typing:

  python rc2udp.py http://example.com/w/api.php 127.0.0.1

The second argument is the IP address to send to UDP packets to. you can
specify the port as a third parameter, the default port is 4455.
