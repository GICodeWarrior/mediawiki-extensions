 * Custom filter using minFraud

 * riskScore from minfraud and adjust it with our own custom filters and
 * risk score modifications.
 *
 * This inherits minFraud settings form the main minFraud extension.  To make
 * transactions run through minFraud outside of custom filters, set
 * $wgMinFraudStandalone = TRUE
 *
 * To install:
 *   require_once( "$IP/extensions/DonationInterface/extras/custom_filters/filters/minfraud.php" );
