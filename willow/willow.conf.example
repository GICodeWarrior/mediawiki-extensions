/*
 * As well as configuration, this file can contain the preprocessor directives
 * "%if", "%pragma" and "%include".
 *
 * %if allows a section of the file to be * dependant on a particular condition.
 * There are two built-in conditions: "true" (which is always true) and "false"
 * (which is always false).  You can add new true conditions by passing
 * -Dcond[=value] on the command line (value should be 1 or 0; default is 1).
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *  %if testing_server
 *    backend "localhost";
 *  %else
 *    backend "remote.host";
 *  %endif
 *
 * %include inserts the contents of an existing file at the point it's used.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *  %include "backends.conf"
 *
 * %pragma sets options in the configuration parser.  Valid options are:
 *
 *   include_path    - add the argument to the search path used to locate
 *                     filenames used in %include.
 *
 * Example:
 *
 *  %pragma include_path "/etc/willow/conf.d"
