In general, it's fine to import source code which is copyrighted, so long as
the copyright terms permit free (re)use, and do not require Willow itself to 
be restricted; e.g., do not import GPL-licensed source code.  Don't require
external dependencies that are not under similar licences.  The Berkeley DB
code is acceptable, because it can be licenced for commercial use.
