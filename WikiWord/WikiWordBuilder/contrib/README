This directory contains libraries that are not readily available from 
a well known Maven repository. For each jar file, there should be
a corresponding pom file as well as a license text.

Before using Apache Maven, please install these libraries into your local
maven repository. You can use the script "install-all" to do this. Maven
will automatically download any other libraries required for building.
