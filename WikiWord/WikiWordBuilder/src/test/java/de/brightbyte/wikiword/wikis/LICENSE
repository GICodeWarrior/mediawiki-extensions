Test files in this directory have been taken from Wikipedia. They are released
under the GFDL and are copyrighted by their individual authors, as listed on
the history page of the respective articles on the Wikipedia it came from.

To find the Wikipedia page a test file came from (and thus, the authors),
consider that the filenames are constructed after the following pattern:

	test_<lang>wiki_<title>.text
	
<lang> is the language code (and thus, subdomain) of the wikipedia, for
example "de" for the German Wikipedia, de.wikipedia.org, and <title> is the
page on that wikipedia, for example "Berlin". So:

	test_dewiki_Berlin.text
	
would have been taken from

    http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berlin
    
On that page, click the tab entiteled "versions" or "history" or "authors" 
or "contributors", to find all copyright holders (the exact title of the tab
is subject to the local community's fancy, as well as your language settings).
