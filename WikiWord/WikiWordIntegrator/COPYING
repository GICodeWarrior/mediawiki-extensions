Wikipedia. It was developed by Daniel Kinzler in 2007-2009.

Development started in 2007 as part of a master's thesis at the
University of Leipzig, see <http://brightbyte.de/page/WikiWord>.

In 2008 and 2009, development continued partially as part of
contract work for Knewco Inc.

Development was supported since 2009 by Wikimedia Deutschland e.V.
